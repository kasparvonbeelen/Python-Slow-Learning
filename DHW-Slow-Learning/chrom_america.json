Haven's division assault*\ned Fort McAllister on the 15th, and carried\nit, capturiug the garrison and stores. This\nopened the channel to the Sound, by which\nbe communicated with the fleet. All the\nrailroads leading into Savannah are destroy\ned, and the city invested. The left is on the\nSavannah River, 15 miles above the city, and\nthe right on the Ogeechee, at King's Bridge,\nSupplies are abuudant and the army in good\ncondition. Two boats were captured on the\nSavannah RiVer, preventing the rebel\ngunboats from coming down. The estimated\nm\npopulation of Savannah is 25,000 : garrison,\n15,000. Hardee is in command. He says he\n\"destroyed over 200 miles of railroad, and\nmany stores essential to Lee and Hood. He\nconcludes by saying, *' 1 regard Savannah as\nalready gained.\"\nThe Herald's correspondent says Sherman's\nentire loss from Atlanta to Savannah was\nabout 1000\u2014traveled about 12 miles per day.\nThe fight around Nashville is still going\non. It is reported that Wood is in Hood's\nrear, and that the rebel forces at Franklin\nwere retreating ; also rumored that Forrest\n' was routed at Murfreesboro on the 15tb.\nRichmond papers say Foster's raid on the\nSaTannuh railroad was a failure, and that\nSavannah is not invested. A proposition is\nmade in Congress to tax all sales one per ct.,\nwhich meets with favor. Copies of orders\n</t Breckinridge are published, ordering his\nmen to husband small arms, ammunition and\nlead. A call and draft for 300,000 more\ntroops has been made by the President . m Bur\nbridge had a fight with Basil Duke's brigade,\nformerly John Morgan's, in Tennessee, routing\nhim and killing Dick Morgan, John Morgan's\nbrother. A rebel rumor says Hood is to be\nreinfprced by Price, Breckinridge and Ma\ngruder. Forrest is near the Hermitage. Hood\nhas fallen back from Nashville, and Thomas\nis pressing him. Wilmington is supposed to\nbe the point aimed at by tbe great expedition\nfrom Hampton Roads. A letter from Lord\nRussell says the British Government will\ncontinue strictly neutral. Dayton, American\nMinister at Paris, is dead. Semraes is on tbe\nSea King, whose name is changed to Shenan\ndoah. The vessel is heavily armed, and 1000\ntons register and very fast.\nThe Yreka Journal of December 9tb,\u2014\n\u00abays it rained and snowed for the\nthree weeks previous, and the country has\nbeen under a flood, causing a great deal of\ndamage. Scott river was difficult to cross ;\nHumbug creek was a river, and Yreke creek\nwas \"booming; Shasta Valley was flooded,\nbat the bridge escaped destruction.\nCol.

How the wind\nsweeps down the narrow Cnfion ! bow madly\nit besieges our little homes that we have\nbuilded here for tbe sake of jobbing these\nbarren old hills of their sepulchered god of\nmen and women. The weather has been very\nmuch akin to a Webfoot winter for the past\nfew days. All day the streets have been\nsloppy and the men hurrying along distress\nedly, dripping and grumbling about the rain.\nTo-night it is dolefully doleful.\n*\u2022 Heart-broken moans the homeless mind\nAs if the whole world was unkind.\"\nNovember is truly a month of sobrietiePj\nof melancholy reveries of gentle memories,\nof half regretful recollections ; it i3 not meet\nfor giddy fancies, for joyous hopes or gay air\npalaces.\nWhen the winds and the rain are weeping\nover us, we too bow our beads and bewail\u2014\nnot bitterly, but with a kind of satisfaction\u2014\nover our broken hopes and weep with the\nNovember rain that the Summer blooms have\nfaded. We say no more the high and hope\nful things that once we said, but witb subdued\nspirits we look back as if through blinding\nrain to tbe misty scenes of the Past and\nwhisper\u2014\" it might bave been.\"\nYes, \"it might have been.\" It might bave\nbeen always Summer, tbe bright flowers\nmight, never have faded, nor the gay leaves\nperished. Fair brows might forever be fair,\nand \" golden hair stay golden ; \" dancing\nfeet might never lose their fleetness, norring\ning voices their music ; buoyant youth might\nuever collapse into old age,\u2014nor hopeful\nhearts, once warm and quick witb love and\njoy, become tbe'borne of dull remorse and\nchill-corroding care.\nSitting here to-night listening to the storm\nand somewhat blues-oppressed, l feel like\ndoing a little wailing myself :\nMY WAIL.\nThe shadows are crouching and filling the room,\nWithout the wild wind blows ;\nAud I sit here in the silence and gloom\u2014\nThis is the life I chose.\nAll day long while the chill rains fall,\nI sit in my chamber and write, 4\nAnd then with the darkness that covers all,\nCome thronging the shadows at night.\nI write of lovo and of broken hearts,\nOf a rest that will come at last,\nAnd smile to think of one I knew,\nAway in the shining past.\n\u00bb\n\u2022To think how over his youthful face\nThe death-white palor came,\nWhen I told him that night in my gauze and lace,\nI had bartered my Love for Fame. \u2022\nThere are voices away in the Long Ago,\nThat could banish the shadows and pain.\nBut tbe Past is laid in a sepulchre low\u2014\u00ab\nIt never will come again.\nLeave, cold shadows, my silent room,\nCreep back from my empty heart;\nLet the past be hid in the silent tomb,\nLet the spectral shadow depart.\n44 Deeply, darkly, beautifully blue,\"\nThis is the life I chose,\nSitting here in the silence and gloom\u2014\nWhere is the \"colour de rose ?\"\nThere, I, have wailed my wail I Now for\nsomething else.\nTHE MINES.\nAll flimsy fancies and idle poetical dream\ning must give way at times to something\npractical and bard. I know of no subject\nmore practical than making money, and gold\nis hard\u2014bard to get, and hard to keep.\nThe mines in this place, I believe, average\nvery well. Some pay big, and some bigger;\nsome pay little, and some less\u2014and some not\nat ail. This is the information I elicited from\na friend of mine. I cannot speak from prac\ntical knowledge, not being a miner myself.\nA very good looking miner came in the\nother evening with his gold pan, and said he\nwanted to show me how much be had taken\nfrom his claim that day. I think there was\nabout a quart of tbe ponderous metal iu the\npan. I offered to introduce him to a nice\nImmigrant girl, but he did not seem to think\nmuch of it.\nCANYON CITY.\nCa\u00fcon City may be destined to become a\ngreat city, and it may not. At any rate it is\nimproving quite rapidly, and some very stylish\nlittle houses are being erected. The Catholic\nChurch is now completed. It is a neat ouild\ning for a mining camp, and stands away up\nun the hill overlooking the town like a guar\ndian angel.\n\u2022 But for fear of trespassing on the columns\nof your pretty little paper, I will bring my\nletter to a close.\nBy the way, we polled quite a nice little\nmajority for McClellan here\u2014or rather our\nmeo did, us \"females\" of course having\nnothing to do with it\u2014but alas 1 it did no\ngood.\n\u00ab^Advertisements, to insure insertion, must be band\ned in os early as Thursday, and the number of insertions\ndesired should be noted on the margin.\nReligious Notices.\u2014 Rev.

The\nWashington correspondent ot the Portland\n(Maine) Advertiser, gives the following facts\nshowing what is the remaining strength of\nthe white forces of the Confederacy, and how\nvery far removed the Southern people are\nfrom exhaustion :\n\" Not one-third of the able-bodied white\nmen of the South have as yet entered the\narmy. The South bad 1,000,000 white men\n-of the proper military age, when the war be\ngin, and 200,000 boys who bave since attain\ned to that age, making 1,800,000 men. The\nStates have furnished up to this time, in all\n850,000 men, of whom 558,000 have perished\nin battle, or by disease. 60,000 are now\nprisoners in our bands, 20,000 are iu bospi\ntala, slightly wounded, and 212,000 constitute\nthe Confederate armies now in the field. They\nhave yet 550,000 white men, from which to\nkeep their armies full, and they do not there\nfore need -the negroes as soldiers.\"\nThose who boast that the war is near an\n\u2022ending, will do well to study these figures.\u2014\nAdd to this the vast number of able-bodied\nnegroes who can and will be summoned to the\nfield, when they deem it politic or necessary\nand the greatness of the work of conquest\nand subjugation yet before the Administra\ntion is made fully apparent. The war as\nprosecuted by the party in power, is only in\nits infancy. The work of \" crushing out the\nrebellion,\" is to be an unending one if noth\ning but brute force is to be employed.\nPolitical Theology. \u2014A correspondent of\nthe Boston Courier, gives the following in\nstances of pulpit interference with the recent\n\u2022lection :\nOne saintly orator proclaims from his pul\npit, recently gilded by urgent appeals from\nthe El Dorado of priests and laity, that every\nvoter at the coining election must feel that ne\nha\u00ab the sacramentt I bread in his band.\nBut on Sunday last, a young friend who has\n^devoted himself to the country's cause in\nmany & well-fought battle, stepped into the\nTremont Temple, in the hope of listening to\nGod's holy word. In lieu of Such a service,\nappropriate to the day, he beard a violent\ndenunciation of Gen. McClellan, and a sym\npathetic and blasphemous harangue in favor\nof Mr. Lincoln, ending as follows: \"Stand\nmp for God ! Stand up for Jesus 1 Stand up\nfor Abraham Lincoln 11\"\nThe late Rev.

He illustrates our\nrampant Americanism by a quotation from\nthe book of Judges. It is there told, as a final\n________ \u201e .\ntfifect of Israel's war with the Pbillistines,\u2014\nthat, \"lo llio.e days there was no King in\ndid that which\nIsrael, but every man\nright in his own eyes.\"\nThan which, continues he, \" ft more faith\nful picture of the men seen in Broadway and\nthe Bowery, at the present moment, could\nnot possibly be written.\" Mr. Willis then\nproceeds in his observations: \"Yet the\nbriakiag out of this pustule of corrupt mat- I\nter on the face of our feverish nation\u2014 1 \" 15\none-man insolence\u2014 \u00ce3 seen no more under\nthe military outton than under the rags of |\nthe beggar.

And it is not seen\nmerely in the twirling of a moustache or the\ndefying of an eye; but who that bas an oc\ncasion to ride in a car, or mingle, as a stran\nger, now-a-days, in a crowd of our great city,\ncan be pleased with the new manners which\ndo certainly prevail\u2014the shouldering and\nelbowing, the rough jostling and rude lan\nguage, the indifference, sulky and savage of\nevery man to his neighbor, ar.d the complete\nun-deferential conduct of every gathering\neverywhere, it for their own independent\npleasure\u2014of men, women and children ?

The whole number\nof votes cast was seven hundred and thirty\nthousand seven hundred and twelve, of which\nthree hundred aud sixty-eight thousand sev\nen hundred and twentj-six were given for the\nLincoln and Johnson electors, and three\nhundred and sixty-one thousand nine hun\ndred and eighty-six for the McClellan and\nPendleton. The Republican majority is\ntherefore six thousand seven hundred and\nforty. Mr. Greeley, one of the Republican\nelectors at large, received two hundred and\nthirty-five votes less than his colleague, Mr.\nPreston King. Between the numbers re\nceived by each of the Democratic electors at\nlarge there was a variance of but five votes,\nMr. Washington Hunt receiving that many\nmore than Mr. Wm. Kelly.\u2014[New York Pa\nper, Dec. 10.\nImportant Decision. \u2014In the case of Pedro\nCasttllo against the Pacific Mail Steamship\nCompany, for $25,600 damages for insufficient\naccommodations as a passenger, and the loss\nof $6,500 in treasure on the Golden Gate,\nthe case ineolcing the entire qneation of the j\nliability of the Company for losses on the\nsteamer, the Court rendered a verdict for the\ndefendants on the ground that the Company\nwas not liable in cases of the total loss of |\na vessel and cargo, and that the receipt did\nnot set forth the exact character, amount and j\nvalue of the package so lost.\n_ \u201e ,, , .\nSCALDSANDBURNS.-Dr. Hall says the best,\nmost instantaneous and most accessible rem\nedy in the world, is to thrust the injured part\nin cold water, send for a physician and while\nhe i9 coming, cover the part an inch or more\ndeep with common flour.

Leader, writing \" from the front,\" on the\nPotomac, or James, says :\nA little further on l came to a reliable de\nserter, who lay on a sand heap scratching\nhimself. These deserters are very nice fel\nlows.\nAs I approached he rose and saluted.\n\"Jes'came f'm 'tuther side, gin'ral,\" says\nhe.\n\"What do you want,\" says I.\n\" I'm powerful dry,\" says he.\nI called an orderly and bade him fetch some\nwhisky.\n\" Now,\" says I, 11 how's things overon your\nside ? \"\n\" Well,\" says he, \"pretty bad. Old Lee,\nhe ain't got no men whatsomever.\"\n\" I guess you lie,\" says I. \" We felt his\nline the other day, and it didn't feel good.\nYou might just as well tell the truth.\"\n\" Oh 1 \" says be, I was only speaking figu\nratively like. He ain't got no men to speak\nof\u2014fifty or sixty hundred thousand, mebbe.\"\n\" H'm, that's enough,\" says I.\n\"Yes, only they ain't good for nothing.\nThey ain't got no ammunition.\"\n\" Tney keep up a devil of a firing,\" says I,\n\" for men without ammunition.\"\n\" Wal, yes,*' says he, \" that's what's run\nthe blockade. Thar's a\ntiou runs the blockade.\"\n\" Short of rations ? \" says I.\n\" Dreadf l short,\" says he. \" We don't get\nonly a cracker every three days.\" .\nII Why, I killed a lot of you up yonder\nwhile ago with their knapsacks full.\"\n\" 0, yes. That's wh&t they got f m the\nShandoah Walley. They got a heap of food\nup yonder. Fact, they h^s all they want to\noat, jes now.\"\n\" You're bound to suit, arn't you,\" says I.\n\" How are you off for ordnance?\"\n\" 0, our ordnance is orf'l,\" says he.\n\"Yes,\" says I, \"Is'pose so. But, young\nnaan, I've got an ordnance, too, about offal,\nand I keep it pretty well cleared out of these\nlines. Now you'd better clear out. I go in\nfor treating my fellow men well, but when it\ncomes to rebels, and lying deserters, and ly\ning deserters at that, I can't say I see it.\nWhat do you expect to do round here?\"\n\" VV^ell,\" says he, \" I kinder thort I'd go\nNorth and play Union refugee. I'm told it\npays fust rate at Lincoln meetin's.\"\n\" And how are you going to get to the\nNorth ?\" \u00bb\n\" I s'pect you'll send me.\"\n\" Do you ?\"\n\"Yes ; if you don't, I'll jes' go back again\nto old Lee, and tell him all I seen in your\nlines.\"\nThis is wha\u00a3 I call a good S^ecinlen of a\nrebel. He went iu for dictating his own\nterms. 1\nI sent him np to headquarters and had him\nhanged.\nOld Abe's Last. \u2014In dismissing & party of\nthree hungry office-seekers, who had often\nwearied him, Mr. Lincoln reminded them of\ntbe schoolmaster who told one his pupils to\nread the third chapter of Daniel. The boy\nbegan, but when he came tbe names of Shad\nrach, Masheck and Abednego, he stumbed.\nTbe master told the boy he might read the\npreceding chapter, and let the present one\ngo. He got on famously nntil he reached the\nlast verse, when, pausing, and casting a sav\nage glance at the book, he exclaimed : \"Well,\nI'll be darned if here ain't them three fellers\nagain 1\", f\n\u2022\nr\n^\nThe Abolition Successor of, Washington\n^ Mr. Lincoln was at first, says the Patterson\n(IL J.) Register, accidentally elected to the\nPresidency of the United States, arid his lack\nof statesmanlike qualities and the culture\nand habits of a gentleman was not so direct\nly a disgrace to the people of this country as\nif he had been fairly elevated to the \"Chief\nMagistracy by a fairly expressed majority.\u2014\nBut the people cannot now escape the odium\nof .having put a mere joker, an uncouth, un\ncultivated fiatboatman, a buffoon, into the\nseat which a Washington honored. The\nmajority of the people so voted, however, and\ncannot avoid the disgrace. Now let every one\nwho gave bis ballot for \"Abraham Lincoln\nread the following {the truth of which is\nvouched for by the World), and rejoice if\nthey can over the elevation of such a man as\nMr. Lincoln, whose classical conversation is\nreported thus:\n\"How do you New York Democratic chaps\ntake my election?\" asked Mr. Lincoln, a few\ndays ago, of a prominent New York McClel\nlanite, with whom the Executive is pleased\nto be on good personal terms. \"Oh, pretty\nWell, on'.he whole,\" was the reply. \"Some\nof Our boys complain, however, that you\ncarried the State by your postmasters steam\ning the envelopes that contained McClellan\nand Seymour votes, thus opening the envel\nopes and substituting Lincoln and Fenton for\nMcClellan and Seymour ballots.\" \"Ha, ha,\"\nlaughed the President, leaning forward and\ngrasping his ancles tightly; \" so they say, do\nthey, that 1 came the 'gum game on them'\nto be re-elected 1 Well, there's one comfort\nabout it, old fellow ; and this you can tell\nthem for me: that if I tried to cheat\u2014\nwhich they also did\u2014by gum! I was success\nful, and they wern't !''\nAnd that is the successor of George Wash\nington 1 i\nA Noteworthy Fact. \u2014An exchange very\ntruthfully remarks that you can always tell\nfrom the advertising columns of a newspaper\nwho do the largest business and sell the\ncheapest. The business man gifted with en\nterprise and industry, having goods to sell,\nwill strive to outstrip his competitors, and\ninform the public through the press what he\nhas for sale. This is so, and if our readers\nwish to test the fact for themselves, let them\nmake a note on their next shopping tour of\nthe difference to be noticed between the es\ntablishments of advertising and non-adver\ntising firms. There will be found evidences\nof thrift, indications of prosperity in the ad\nvertising firm, a \" snap\" and wide awake air\nabout the employers and clerks, in striking\ncontrast with dull-, plodding ways of the \" old\nfogies,\" who don't \" waste \" money in adver\ntising. If purchasers wish to know where\nthey will find the choicest goods and the\nnewest styles, they will carefully study the\nadvertising columns of their home paper,\nThe examination of drafted men in tbif\ntown closed on last week. Of the 211 men\ndrafted 1 was dead ; 2 were non-residents ; 62\nwere discharged on the ground of disability;\n46 paid cdmmutationf 49 failed to appear;\n3 were under age; 9 Were overage; 3 fur\nnished substitutes' 14 were in the service;\nand 16 are yet to pay or furnish substitutes.\nOf the three substitutes, one is now in jail\ncharged with murder. So that but two men\nout of the number drafted have found their\nway into the army and they are Canadian\nsubstitutes. One might fairly infer from\nthese facts that Old Abe's war for the nigger\nis not very popular. \" The people (\u00ee\u00ebmhnd\na vigorous prosecution of the war.\" Will\nthe \"Loyal Leaguers\" hereabouts point out\nthe \"white feather party,\" against which they\nprated so loudly, three years ago. We opine\nthe \" peace party\" is now the dominant one,\nso far as numbers are concerned.\u2014[Eastern\nPaper.\n7\nOnr of the Spirit-Wrappers.\u2014 A man was\nin the street the other night, who bad evi\ndently taken in too much of the ardent for\nconvenient storage, and was rather unquietly\nresting himself against a lamp-post, when an\nacquaintance came aloDg, and observed that\ntbe afflicted individual had on a new over\ncoat.\n\"Well, Bob,\" said he, \"guess you have\nbeen indulging in a new overcoat.\"\n\"Coat?\" replied Bob, giving bis hat a\nknock, and endeavoring to gesticnlate; \" this\nain't a coat.\"\n\" Is n't a coat, eh ? Well, Bob, what is it,\nthen?\"\nBcb elevated himself to a tottering pigpen\ndicular, and exclaimed: \"This 'ere ain't a\ncoat\u2014it's a spirit-wrapper !\"\nMasonry. \u2014Oh I who can tell the worth of\nthe Masonic Order?

Upon the introduction of the\n^ Bounty bill, (framed in the \u00dfanctum of his\nExcellency, and, therefore, his pet,) party\nlines were drawn, and woe be to the waver\ning. The mandate of his Highness had gone\nforth, that the pretext for robbing the hardy\npioneers of Idaho should receive the sanction\nof the Legislature ; that it might be legiti\nmately done under statute law. The friends\nof the bill were disinclined to give its pro\nvisions a very extensive airing,\u2014choosing,\nrather, to pass the matter through without\nattracting much attention. At length it\nbecame understood that, did they succeed\neasily in the Council, the House was not\ndisposed to allow so gross an outrage upon\nthe people of this Territory to be perpetrated\nwith impunity. Although so modified as to\nseem not wholly impracticable on its face,\nstill the tax levied under its provisions\nsolely for a \"bunkum\" record to lay before\nFather Abraham\u2014amounted to $45,000. The\nfirst proposition called lor $144,000, which\nwas much nearer the actual amount needed.\nHuge \" bunkum \" speeches from the Repub\nlicau members (who need re-election to keep\ntheir seats) were made, lauding the Adminis\ntration to the skies, and denouncing all who\nrefused to fall down and worship the image\nthat Caleb of \" Lyonsdale \" had set up, that\nlor the want of a faithful reporter for your\njournal, will be lost to their constituents\nforever. Praise of worthy mefit is a delight\nful theme; when undeserved, however, it\nbecomes the most withering sarcasm. There\nfore, in claiming tljat \"we owe this to our\ngovernment at home, from the fact that she\nhas ever extended her protecting hand over\nus,\"\u2014and this claim set up in tbe face of the\nfact that, on the contrary, we have so far not\nonly paid all the usual taxes levied by our\ngovernment upon bid settled States,\u2014but we\nfbave also supported, at our o.wn expense, and\nfrom an almost empty treasury, all the dis\nreputable Federal officers sent here. Does\nour government need these troops ? and what\nfor ? If we have to support (in addition to\nthe officers we have no voice in electing)\nstanding army, let the people have some voice\nin the matter. Yoiir correspondent listened\nattentively to the arguments,\u2014or rather\n\"bunkum,\" of the Republicans in both\nHouses, and it was also generally observed\nthat they left the merit of the bill untouched\nSeveral good third rate Fourth-of-July ora\ntions were had over it, and finally the funeral\n6ermon was duly preached over it, and its\ncompanion\u2014the Militia bill, by the Reverend\nmember, in the House, from Idaho. Thus\n10 xvv\nfoil as mad a scheme, and as destructive to\nthe best interests of the Territory, as ever\nentered the brain of a fanatic.\nThe last day of the session at length came,\nand with it a rather rich joke not wholly\nwithout its lesson. During the passing of\nparty measures through the Council, of course\nthe Democracy were in the minority. This\nenabled the Republicans to choke off discus\nsion frequen'.ly, without authority of law, or\nthe rules of \" Jefferson's Manual.\" Upon\nseveral occasions this was done with impuni\nty, and the Chair, sustained by a majority, of\ncourse, and at the expense of the minority.\nHowever, an opportunity occurred for a little\nsport, which had been concocted in the House,\nby going into Joint Convention, and a reso\nlution was passed through both Houses to\nthat effect.* Here was an opportunity to get\njustice, as we would have a clear working\nmajority. A series of resolutions reviewing\nthe conduct of Federal officers, who had been\nsent amongst us, were hastily drawn up, and\nat an opportune moment offered by Mr. Fenn\nof the Council, from Idaho. In a moment\nthe countenances of tbe Opposition members\nchanged from the self-satisfied smile of tri\numph won by them, for the last three weeks,\nto the most blank look of surprise. The\nreader can better imagine the ludicrous\nspectacle presented if, in his schoolboy days,\nhe ha3 seen a large boy domineer, tyrannize\nover, aad tantalize a smaller one before the\nwhole school until, by some unforeseen in\ncident, he comes suddenly in contact with his\nvictim and finds himself completely in his\npower. As might be expected from former\nconduct, tbe \" big boy \" ran away. Thus it\nproved with the Council majority\u2014they\n\"bolted\" from the house, disgracefully leav\ning the field, and refusing to accept an equal\nshow and a fair fight\u2014saluted with shouts of\nlaughter from the lobby as they went. This\nis Republican honor and sound Republican\ninciple?.\nTHE CAPITAL, AND OTHER QUESTIONS.\nThe Capital question is becoming rather a\nvexed one to everybody. Your correspondent\nnot being in the ring, can give but little infor\nmation with regard to it. Blackstone seems\nto have been consulted in the matter and, if\ncorrectly interpreted by some of the ' Solons,'\nI fear they will decide the last Assembly a\nbogus body sure enough. This will sadly in\nterfere with the operation of many healthy\nlaws passed during the last session.\nThe different applicants for tbe office of\nTerritorial Auditor and Territorial Treasurer,\nwill, also materially retard the business in\nthose offices. I havejust learned that Dr. M\nA. Kelly, who was elected Territorial Treas\nurer, has his bonds ready and will apply for\na certificate ; also, that Dr. E. Smith, appoin\nted by the Governor and Legislative Council\nis preparing his;\u2014meantime, writs y of in*\njunction are being served on D. S. Kenyon\nforbidding him deliverfng over to either any\nbooks, records, or papers, belonging to said\noffice,\u2014to which he also puts in a claim that\nhe was duly appointed to for the term pre\nscribed by the statute, viz. : two years.\nThese numerous questions will hardly be\ndecided until near the expiration of the term\nclaimed by Kenyon. Thus the matter stands.\nPallas.\nDemocratic Central Committee, Ada Co.\nheld at Boise City, Ada county, I.

I have enough infomn:tion on the\nsuhject, however, to warrant m.n in saving\nthat, though in quantity. quality, and va\nrictv our timher is iiferior to that of the\nPuit fie and Nortbhrn States, yet we have\nan ample supply for a large population, for\neneroations to come. Nature has been far\nmore lib.ral with us in this respect, than\nbhe has been with some of the Westeru\nStates and some of our neighboring Ter\nritories.\nThe south-eastern portion of the Terri\ntorf, from its etsatern Imit to the tributaries\nof the Yellowstone, is little else than a\nsterile waste. Of course there is but little\ntimber there. Indeed, outside of the Black\nHills, the wild sage, prickly pear and grease\nwood are about the only species of vegeta\ntion that relieve the country of utter bar\nrenness. Unless the allurements of mine\nral wealth in \"this section shall prove to be\nsalicientlv great to attract thither the en\nterprising gold-seeker, it will ever reamain\nwhat it ndw it, a wild, desolate, inhospitat\nble region utterly itwrthles to ian. It4,\ngeneral charaeter and appearances s well\ndescribed b 4 frol *eat Ms, tig's\n\" A desert solitude, alone appears,\nNo vealant shade Ieliees the sandy plain,\nThe wid.- (read weste no gentle feastain cbeenr;\nOne b.uren face the dreary pro pes rears;\nNought through the vast horloun m~lsa thes .\nBut sany wilds beneath, above, a thraaning sky.\"\nFrona Wind river westward, the' ibli in,\ncreaces in fertility, and vegetation becomes\nmore pltntiful. The hills and v$es are\ncovered with nutritious grasseq. the\n1streams are flanked by lines of cott~tiwocd;\nand the higher mountains are crowned w.th\nforests of evergreens. When you reach\nthe more promieut spars of the ky\nMountrins, the roleteia 'ilanon are\nidarkened far up the mountain sides with\nbJi:s of cedar and pine-the species of\ntimber which predorminates in the count-ry.\nIn the northern part of the Territory, I am\ninformed that the timber is far mole abun\nd:mt than it is here. But it is a fact t3 be\nlanment.:d that there is no hard wood to be\nfound in the Territory-no oak, no hicko\nry; noth'ng out of which can be made even\nan axe helve or a wagon spoke. We sh:al,\nhercefore. a!.wavs have to depend on \" t':o\nt:tcs \" for this kind of timber, and th:is\ndlep: ndcnee will ever he a serious debri\nunet to the prosecution of some of the me\nS.h1.1Aic:li arts inl this cuintrv.\n'The prinicipal kinds of timnhcr about Vir\ng:ni.t are spruce, a bastard white pine, and\na sp:cio called fir, wh ch very imuch re\nsi niblcs what in the Pacific Stars is termed\n\": Uregon pine.\" The spruce and the rine,\nare genera small, but the tire are of i\ng* ow th t.irg, nogh for proftable lun:h~jbr\ninc. But the timber here, like in tioo\nother mountainous coun:ries, is g nerahv\nfound ncstl.d in the n arrow gu ce:ca and\nhollows, where it is dittienit of access. I:i\nnorth-oastern California, immediately wre\nof the Si rra Nevadas, ia a recion front\nwhich ci\\ ivization will most probably be for\ncv:.r ex,;lu:led, we have seen forets of rint\nSand redwood which were so mai etie in siz,\n:ai to , x,:ite the astonishbuent oi the trarvl\nt er.

Ships hare bien\njumping and pouddinn -against wharves,\nand performing perfectly wonderful fdast\nof agility, and crinoline showing a .reat\ndesire to reverse its most. beeomingP oati\nBut once mor ' order reig\u00fds.rid\nand business can be peaeeably proceeded\nwith. But oh, good Lord! business n'ow\nof all kinds is in a terrible state of decline.\nCensumption has fastened its firm hold up\non it, and unless some Dr. Wistar or Aver\nshall gct up some Wild Cherry Balsam for\nbuisness, as well as lungs, I fear the dis\nease will b3 fatal.\nBut some two or three letters ago, I com\nmonced to write you about the amusements\nof San Francihcans. Well next to horse\nracing comes riding out, and in the imme\ndiate vicinity of this city are so many\nplaces of entertainment that when one\nwishes to expend ten or twenty dollars for\nhis own pleasure, and the delectation of\nthat particular piece of crinoline that take,\nhis eye, the only trouble is to decide in\nwhat direction to go-the Ocean House,\nthe Cliff House, Angolo's, the Willows,\n&c., &c., &c.--in short, so many of them,\nthat there really can be no decisioa on the\npart of the male biped, and the taste or\nfancy of the lady must decide the question.\nWell we suppose she decides for this time\nto go to the Cliff House. You procure a\nbuggy and start over the high hills in the\nrear of the city, passing by the beautiful\nsuburban residences of the rich men of\nFrisco, and coming to the plateau in the\nrear of the town, where a view of greater\nbeauty than -often can be seen, is before\nyou. Before you, in the distance, is the\nvast, blue expanse ofthe Pacific, dotted with\nsails, and sparkling in the sunbeams. To\nyour right, the Golden Gate, with its tcn\nmiles of straight navigation, the further\nshores rising into wild cliffs, and broken\nchasms that speak its volcanic origin-the\nnearer side gently falling back from the\nwater, and covered with villas, private\nresidences and manufactories; while fur\nther out, the regularly laid out grounds,\nthe rows of barracks, the lofty flag staff with\nthe glorious st: rs and stripes, andi more\nthan all, the bright uniforms and dashing,\ncaparisoned horses around, proclaim the\n\"Presidio, the great depot of troops in Cal\nifornia, and beyond this, the frowning bas\u00f7\ntions of Fort Point, while in the channel,\nand covering and gnarding the whole, lies\nthe little giant Alcatraz-little, but as the\nthe nigger said of his pig, \"dam old.\"\nA.s you go on you pass beautifully laid out\ngrCunds and fertile fields, where two years\nago, nothing but sand hills existed, till at\nthe distance of two miles, you pass the\nLone Mountain Cemetery the \"Pere la\nChasse,\" of the Pacific. Here, amidst\nflowers and evergreens rest the remains of\nthousands of those who have come to this\ncountry with high minded hopes, and ex\npectations of wealth, and the anxious de\neiro to return to friends at home, to pass\nthe sunset of life with them. Alas ! they\nhave fallen in the struggle, and passed\nfrom earth, but amid the beauties of this\nplace we may well think and hope that \"af\nter life's fitful fever, they sleep well.\" Well\nwe go on and move through sand hills and\nbrush, till suddenly we open upon a view\nwhere the ocean seems laid out at your\nfeet, spreading in vast magnificence before\nus, a semixirele of whIclh the onut cxtreme\ny: made of the Southern point of the en\ntrance to the harbor, and on the high point\njust below the entrance stands the Cliff\nlie ~s. Every luxury is there, both in the\neating or drinking line. Blliards, tenpins,\ncards are the order of the day, but after\ntaking a lemonade, and ordering our din\nner, as we have a lady along we of course\neschcw the common \" noisy and boisterous\na\u2022.Jseineu.s\" of'the sterner sex, and ram-,\nbIl around to view the secnery. You are\nupon the shores of old ocean. To the left\nstrct.Lce a long line of beautiful sand\nbeach, where for .nilcs you can ride on a\nplain as hard as though manufactured for\nthat end, where the long seas roll up their\nline of silver foam making a deep diapason\nof harmony that well attunes with the sub\nblimity of the prosrcot before vou, brokeu.\nat times, by the angry rush aniYclash of the\nbillows as they meet the iron-clad roc of\nthe heads, or dash in insane fury up\non the sides ofSeal Rock. This peculiar\nrock lies lice nearly in front of the house,\nand at a slhort distance from the shore, and\nrises from the wat.r to the height of\nnearly fifty feet. The steep and slippery\nsides are continually covered with seals,\nliterally, in heaps. They seem to have a\npeculiar affection for the place,and although\nalmost in the immediate presence of crowds\nwho daily come to the Cliff Irouse--they,\ngenerally the most timid of animals, here\nseem to feel themselves at home with man.\nThe proprietors do not allow them to be\nshot at or disturbed in any way, and thug\nappear to appreciate the delicate attention.\nBut most of all, one can be alone with old\nocean, and appreciate fully Montgomery's\nbeautiful lines:\n\" All hail i to thy rings, thy rooks, snd thy snores,\nThou wide rolling ocean, all hail !\nNow sparkling in sunbeams and dimpled with oars,\nAnd now dark with the fresh morning gale.\"\nNo one, however lost to the finer feelings,\ncan come to its shores and the vast, illimit\nable expanse before him, and hear the deep,\nsolemn tones of its voice, without feeling\nhis own ilsigniieaneo in the balle qfbeing\nand the sense of pleasing sadness that\ncomes over him, is that which wqmld beast\nprepare the heart to,$omianne With its\nmaker.

All\nthe luxuries of the season, and all import\ned luxuries are at your command if your\npurse is long enough, and after a long, and\nif in good company, a happy day, you re\nta~rn at night to the city, to again return to\nyour usual emyloyment, rested and recruit\ned by a day of sensible and healthy\namusement--about the most sensible of all\nthe ways of spending money that Califor\nnia presents. Should you not be fond of a\nsea trip-or if in bal health, you may vary\nby going to the Nappa or Sulphur Springs,\nor in fact, a hundred other places, so well\nkept and respectable, others of the very\nopposite character, and one has need to\nknow the difference before taking a re\nspectable lady with him. But our trip has\nlasted long enough for the present. Au\nrevoir. DlSDICADO.\nSAN FRANCIsco, Dec. 25, 1864.\nMY DEAr. POST :--A merry Christmas to\nyou and yours, though'tis not to me. Sol\nitary and alone, I sit at my desk writing to\nyou, while in every direction around friends\nare meeting. Families long separated, are\nagain united, and the thousand amenities\nof life are bringing even strangers together.\nBut with al. this, \"the disinherited \" in\nwealth and honor has no part, and can only\nfrom his distant place look on, like Dives\nin torment, with not even a hope for the\ndrop of water to cool his parched tongue.\nWhat blessed memories cluster around the\nday ! What loving remembrances of pa\nrents, brothers, sisters and friends-all,\nperhaps, long since gone to their home in\nheaeen. My mother's gentle hand! I\nseem to feel it resting once inmore upon my\nbrow, while I sit thus silent and alone, on\nthi*: day of joy and happiness, and hear\nher loving voice as it was in my childhood\ngiving comfort and hope in my troubles now\nas it did to my childish afflictions then.\nGod bless her memory, and again, in re\nmembrance of her, I say \" a happy, happy\nChristmas to you and vours.\"\nI commenced, some time ago. writin you\nabout the amusements of the Friscais,\nthinking that it would perhaps occupy one\nor two pages. Well, I have written some\nten or twenty pages of it, and still, like\nthe phantom kings in Macbeth, they stretch\non and on, and I fear that you, like him,\nwill soon exclaim, \" I'll see no more.\" But\nI should he lacking in even a common pen\nand ink sketch of the city did I not men\ntion the pastime that has given to Frisco\nthe name of the \"City of Billiards.\"\nThere is a perfect mania for that game.\nEverybody plays it. I can't swear that\nStarr King played, but if he did not, I\nthink he was the only man in the city.\nNew York is the great oyster city, and when\none has nothing to do there he eats oysters.\nIn Frisco, in the same case, he plays bil\nliards. I'm not sure, but 1 think you could\nfind here billiards fried,\" \" billiards stew\ned,\" and \" billiards on the half shell.\"\nEvery corner salooc has its table or tables.\nEvery grog shop on the wharf has its like\nness, and the second story over almost\nevery store on Montgomery and Kearnev\nstreets, is fitted up with from two to twenty\ntables. It would be a matter of curiosity\nto collect the statistics of billiard playing\nhere, but the arithmetical knowledge re\nquired \"sizes my pile.\" The Bank Ex\ncha:.ge boasts the fist.\"t bil aiar Ll in tLe\nUnited States-a room one hundred feet by\nfifty, with eighteen tables of the very first\nclass, thirty feet in height, (the hall, not\nthe tables.) and ornamented as highly as\ntaste will permit. From this down Lo the\nsailor's boarding house on the wharf, all\nare going, and it is a safe calculation that\nevery male inhabitant of San Francisco\nspends one-quarter of his waking hours in\nplaying Lillids. I can't answer for the\nwomen, for though they have their billiard\nrooms, we poor devils who have no criao\nline to dance attendance on, can \" gec to\nSgo\" there-but it is said that they have\nlearned to handle a cue in a style that\nwould put many a sharp to his trumps to\ncompete with them.\nWe had a queer thing come off here last\nnight, (excuse me, but I told you I should\nlet my pen run,on whatever came into Imy\nmind). Some wag of rascal got up an ex\ntra, purporting to come from the Alta and\nBulletin3 the papers that monopolize the tel\negraph giving a long and interesting ac\nacount of the taking of Savannah, asnault\non Richmond. Lee's army destroy od, fight\ning in the streets of Ricumond,-Ben Butler\nkilled, and gold at 84, less than par. All\nthe news boys were supplied at the same\ntime, and in every part of the city you\ncould hear nothing but shouts of joy, un\nless it were themonotonous cry of \"'Ere's\nyour extra Alta and Bulletin.\" Every one\nwas excited-some with joy, some with\nhope, and some with fear. Arrangements\nwere made for a grand illumination and\nspeechification, when the Alta folks, who\nof course knew it was a hoax; started out\nthe police, and soon filled the station with\nblubbering news boys, and at last, with the\ngetters-up of the thing. They will be\nbrought up on Monday, but I have been\nbothered to know what head of the orimi\nnal law the offence will come under. Is it\nforgery, or obtaining money under false\npretences? I think it will bother Judge\nShepherd to locate it. But it would hare\nmade Democritus laugh to see the violent\nindignation of those who were the worst\nsold. Nothiag short of capital punishment\nfor the authors would have satisfed them,\nand strong talk that Gieeral McDowell\no.ght to issue an order consigning all en\naged in it to Aleatras as traitors-news\nhyls and all, was rife with the hoazees.\nTo-day, bewever, they are partially recer\nere44 and most seem tr o, tp it t a '\nter geo sell eUand ueti\n,.~-, ,\nIn these days, when mining elaims have I\nturned out so badly, and so many men have\nbeen ruined by speculating in bogus stocks,\nthe men who have money to spend and in\nvest, have been obliged to look for other\nmeans of making money, and accordingly,\nthe raising of cotton has become a promi\nnent branch of business. The Mexican\nprovincee. f Sonora had Sinaloa, at pres\nent are the familiar grounds, and every few\ndays companies and individuals are going\nfrom here with a view to cultivating the\ncotton lands in those provinces. The new\ngovernment of Mexico is said to be very\nfavorably disposed towards the business,\nand some parties that bavieOea T.here\nabout eighteen months, have already sue\nseeded so well that the it is reduced to a\ncertainty that the Pacific coast is to be one\nof the greatest cotton growing countries in\nthe world. The expense is said to be but\nvery little compared with the profit, and the\nprofit is such that the rush to get into the\nbusiness is now commencing to be very\ngreat. Those who have cotton growing are\nnow looking very proud, and hold their\nheadd high up in the air, and those who\nhave not, are hoping when they shall be in.\nIn fact, for those who have a small capital\nand energy, there is no safer investment\nin the world, and when your miners have\nmade their pile of two or three thousand\ndollars, they can go to Mazatlan and live\neasily, in the very finest climate in the\nworld, and make money with very little la\nbor. The only objection to Mexico is the\ninternal troubles that have been, and still\nare convulsing that unhappy country, and\nthose who fear to invest on that account are\nlooking to the islands of the Pacific. The\nSandwich and Society Islands are found to\nbe far ahead of any cotton countries, both\nfor cheapness of la.bor and fertility of soil,\nand the French government at Tahiiti oifers\nevery inducement to capital and labor to\nfro ac *A\" ouVL , JU1 CVYy IUIFCtUil\nfrom San Francisco new fields of labor are\nopening, new means of investing capital are\nfound, and though the Pacific is a new\nfield, the eeds are being sown, which, when\ntime has allowed them to mature, will place\nher, for indusiry and wealth, far ahead of\nthe Atlantic shores, and our children will\nhereafter see such an improvement in all\nher bounds, they will forget from whence\ntheir prosperity arose, and the old Atlantic\nbe considered as an old fogy country and\nYoung America will have taken leave of\nthe Bowery and Chatham streets, and taken\nup his residence at San Francisco, where\neven now you find a very fair likeness of\nhim around the engine houses and stand.ng\non the favorite corners of Montgomery\nstreet. By the way, I must hereafter tell\nyou something of vur fire boys and fire de\npartment, and give you an insight, if pos\nsible, into one of the greatest and most\ngrowing interests of California, viz: the\nwine making. We now have all kinds of\nnative wine and brandy, from light red to\nchamnpaine, and equal, in every respect, to\nthe imaported articles.

Business is dull and times\nare hard, and so is the ground, for we have\nhad a week of bitter cold weather, in fact\nthe coldest known here for many years.\nThe roads are in splendid condition for\n} sleighing, and people are inclined to take\nadvantage of it, for every one who can get\ntwo boards for runners, a dry goods box for\na bo.i, and a quadruped to haul them,\nhave their sleigh ride. Several of the\nlarge companies about here have been dis\ncharging a good many hands in the last\nweek, but whether it ie to give them a\nchaice .ur the holidays, or whether the\nSclaims are fizzling, deponent sayeth not.\nBalls and parties are still all the rage, and\nI beiicve some people have come to the\nconclusion to follow the advice of the sage\nold owl. \" 11! hoot !\" says the owl. It\nis the best way to dance all night and sleejp\nnext dav. But you have no doubt observcd\n\"in the course of human events\" that\nwhen young men have nothing or but little\nt to do, their minds become kind of n;uddled\nup and confused with the ideas of cherry\nlips, rosy cheeks, ruby wine, fantastic toes,\nfairy waists, heavenly music, etc. ha! ha!\nIt is a bad case, as the M.

I think a geutle\nman from Virginia, M.

But the gentleman at whose house\nshe was stopping, wts, int e meantime,\nmaking some inquiries Ibout the gay 1-\nand found he was not only corresponding\nwith a young lady in San Francisco, but\nthat he also has a family in New York.\nHeavy nrews, you will say. Wcll, the up\nshot of it was, the lady's friends brought\nthe gay gentleman to an account, and for a\nwhile there was a strong scent of tar and\nfeathers about the premises, but he begged\nso hard that he finally got off by binding\nhimself never to come near the lady again.\nBut the lady is \"tabooed,\" as the New Ze\nlanders say, for a while in society, and\nthat will be an awful punishmunt to her ini\nthese gay times, aud she may well' euclaim\n\"Ehaat's this gap tows to ie.\"\nBut mid all t!he sports, riding down hill\noaa band-sled appears to b the most pop.\nSile, for e., beo ssad p4~t tolks ~e\nit when bsines.willpermt.

Many will no doubt ex\nclaim : \" Oh, God I would that I could re\ncall it, how different should be my record\nwhen the end came again.\" But that can- 4\nnot be. The old year is past, nothing can\n.be recalled; but we hate a new ymu..in\nwhich to \" shape our ends,\" and we may,\nby good resolutions improve our future.\nWe have here in our city some four or five\nministers, who are trying their best to help\nus on our way; but each directs us in a\ndifferent path to the same destination, and\nit confuses us so that we don't know what\nto do, so we try to stand still, but we can't.\nOn we have to go, and first we know, we\nare lost in darkness.\nPoliticians are rather quiet now, except\nthose who are about the Legislature at Car\nson, where the assembled wisdom of the\nState is endeavoring to pass some laws to\ngovern rogues, (good men need no govern- I\ning), but I think they succeed but Doorly,\nfor shooting and cutting still continues.\nWe had a sample of it here on Christmas\nEve. One Joseph Randall, a private watch\nman, while enjoying himself at a high-toned\nball in a house of ill-fame, got shot in the\nleg below the knee, fracturing the bone\nbadly. His recovery is very doubtful.\nAnother man, who kept a low whisky shop\nof the \" copperhead\" ilk, got stabbed in\nthe breast three times, and his recovery is\nalso uncertain. But still the \"unterrified\"\nkept it up boldly all night and next day,\nand by evening, our city boarding house\nwas well filled. I believe the Legislature\nhas passed the \"Specific Contract Law,\"\nand that will help to make men do as they\nagree.\nMarriages, parties and balls are still the\nrage. Nearly every evening there are two\nor three balls, though the weather has be\ncume moderate, and the snow melted so as\nmake the roads wet and sloppy, the devotees\nof pleasure don't mind that, but splash on\nthrough mud and mire, and consequently\nmany of them are complaining of sore\nthroats, bad colds, etc. Never mild-let\nthem slide.\nFarming will soon begin to take the toil\ners' attention. Ranchmen are procuring\nseed and preparing their ground, and ex\npect to raise large crops of barley, oats\nand vegetables this year. \"So mote it be,\"\nbut I hope the miners will raise heavier\ncrops from their croppings, from which the\nmills will be able to pound out a good sup\n$!j of,; kalne fefd ~a\",ln L t\"&u@ofi\neverybody is anticipating a brisk spring\ntime, with a large increase of people and\ncapital. Let them come. The sooner our\nvalleys are settled, the sooner the red-skin\nned devils will be taught their place and be\nmade to work for their living, as well as\nthe rest of us. They have become some\nwhat troublesome in the southern part of\nour country, stealing horses, cattle, &c.,\nfor which they received a small obhastise\nment, at the hands of the ranchmen.\nThere were three killed and several wound\ned. The stock was recovered, excepting\nwhat had been killed. Since that they\nhave kept a little more civil, and I think\nthey had better remain so. If they don't,\nthere will be several Shoshone widows\nmade for an old BACHELOR.\nI\nEastern Correspondenoe.\nCoNcoRD, Mich., Dec. p., 1864.\nEDrroR Post :-I have just received two\ncopies of your excellent paper, which re\nminds me of my promise to send you oc\ncasional items from the States. Poor\nhealth must be my excuse for not writing\nbefore. My last was written from Denver.\ncity, where I had the pleasure of meeting\nmany of your old Colorado friends. Messrs.\nReese, Kratzer and myself left there for\nthe Missouri, October 1st, with a pair of\nmules and a light wagon. It was danger\nous travelling to Fort Kearney, a distance\nof four hundred miles, as the Indians in\nhostile bands were infesting the road most\nof the way. We went through to Omaha\nin twenty days with but little trouble. On\nthe evening of the 12th of October, we\nwere camped nine miles above Plum creek,\nwhen a band of Indians attacked the stage\ncoach going west, within sight e.nd hearing\nof us. One of the leading horses was killed,\nwhich stopped the coach, and one of the\nguards was severely wounded in the head,\nand a passenger, Mr. Jacobs, of Central\nCity, Colorado, slightly wounded in the\nankle. The passengers made a breast\nwork of the coach and gallantly returne''\nwork of the coach and gallantly returner,.\nthe fire of the Indians, and after firing a\nfew rounds, killing, as supposed, two of\nthe red skins. The balance of them ran\nfor the bluffs, where their ponies were, and\nmade their escape. The Indians were at\nthe time supposed to be Cheyennes, but the\narrows-of which I picked up four the next\nmorning-were Sioux, as the Pawnee In\ndians told me at Columbus. The Sioux,\nCheyennes and Arapahoos have been very\ntroublesome since about the first of August\nlast, and if not thoroughly whipped and\nwiped out during the winter, will be far\nmore so next summer. Col. Chivington\nwith a force of Colorado troops, had a se\nvere fight with them a few weeks since,\nkilling about 500 of them and taking a\nlarge number of ponies and other trophies,\nand if this success is followed up with it is\nto be hoped they will be successfully put\ndown so that by the time the next summer's\nemigration commences it will be cowpara\ntively safe crossing the plains. From pres\nent appearances the emngratio., to Montana\nand the other Territories w:l be small the\ncoming year, owing mos\"'y to the unfavor\nable reports, of the tl.ouands of siek pil\nrims who have returned this #a.

Thomas has just had a\nsevere battle with Hood at Nashville, and\nwhipped him severely. Sheridan is active\nin tej Shenandoah valleys and successful.\nGrant is also quite active, and has lately\ncut one of Lee a important railroad com\nmunieations, so you see, that it thunders\nM all 4nd the horison of e..eldom, More\nan Yours truly. H. C. N.\nO11 Clothes and What Beoemes of\nThem.\nThe London Times has a curious article\nshowing what becomes of tP e4 clothes\npicked up in London :\nThose that are intended to remain in\nthis coutry have to be tutored and trans\nformed. The \"clobberer,\" the \"reviver,\"\nand the \"translator\" lay hands upon them.\nThe duty of the \"clobberer\" is to patch,\nto sew up and to restore, as far as possible,\nthe garments to their pristine appearance:\nblack cloth garments pass into the hands of\nthe \" revivers,\" who rejuvenate seedy black\ncoats, and, for the moment, make them\nlook as good as new. The \"translator's\"\nduty is of a higher order; his office is to\ntransform one garment into another-the\nskirts of a cast off coat, being the least\nworn part make capital waistcoats and\ntunics for children, &c. Hats are revived\nin a still more wonderful manner. They\nare cut down to take out the grease marks,\nre-lined, and appear like new ones. The\nstreets surrounding the old clothes' market\nare full of shops where these \"clobbered\"\nand \"revived\" are exposed for sale, and\nreally a stranger to the trade would not\nknow but they were new goods. There is\na department of the market also dedicated\nto old clothes, male and female, \" clobber\ned\" and \"revived.\"\nIt is a touching sight to see the class of\npersons who frequent the men's market and\nturn over the seedy black garments that are\ndoing their best to rut on a good appear\nance-the toil worn clerks, who for some\nsocial reason are expected to apparel them\nselves in black, and the equally careworn\nmembers of the clerical profession, chiefly\ncurates whose meagre stipends do not per\nmit of the extravagance of new suits of\nclothes. The ladies' market is a vast ward\nrobe of silk dresses ; but, if we are to be\nlieve the saleswoman, the matrons of Eng\nland are more thrifty than we gave them\ncredit for. \"Servants come to purchase,\nsir! No, indeed, sir; ladies worth hun\nour Inquiries as o Te cass of purchasers.\nBlack cloth clothes that are too far gone to\nbe \"clobbered\" and\" revived \" are always\nsent abroad to be cut upto make caps.\nFrance takes the best of these old clothes for\nthis purpose. The linings are stripped out,\nand in this condition they are admitted\nduty free as old rags.\nRussia and Poland, where caps seem to\nbe universally worn by the working popu\nlation, are content with still more thread\nbare garments to be cut up for this purpose.\nThe great bulk of our cast-off clothes of all\nkinds, however, find their way to two mar\nkets-Ireland and Holland. The old clothes\nbags of the collectors may, in fact, be said\nto be emptied out in the land of Erin, as far\nas the ordinary order of clothes go, while\nto Holland only special articles of apparel\nare exported. Singularly enough, the des\ntination of the red tunics of the whole\nBritish infantry is the chests of the sturdy\nDutchmen. The sleeves are cut off, and\nthey are made to button in a double-breast\ned fashion ; thus remodeled, they are worn\nnext to the skin like a flannel waistcoat by\nall careful Dutchmen among the laboring\nclasses. The Irish chiefly favor corduroys,\nand we suspect the worn-out legs of Brit\nish pantaloons of this material are cut off\nand made into breeches for Pat. Ourread\ners will perhaps have noticed the special\navidity the dealers in old clothes evince for\nall kinds of regimentals, full dress liveries,\nvolunteers' uniforms, beadles' coats, &e.\nOne of the largest dealers in London ir. t\nthese showy dresses once said to us, ser.ng\na guardsman going along the strr.et, \" A\nthousand to one that coat eomes into my\nhands.\" A Lord Mayor's footman's full\ndress livery is viewed by t ese gentry with\nwolfish eyes. These are the great prizes of\nthe profession--.nd tleir barbaric splendors a\nare destined for a special market-the\nSouth Coast of Africa. We ourselves saw 1\nan assortmer.s of well preserved liveries of I\nthe heir to the proudest throne in the\nwog:ld, just packed for exportation to the\ngrand destination of all fine liveries we\nhave just mentioned. It should be some\nsolace to the parish beadle that his clothes,\ninstead of descending in the social scale\nlike those of ordinary civillians, are des\ntined to flame upon the back of some auto\ncrat who holds the lives of thousands of\nmen at his disposal, instead of only being\nthe emblems of terror to poor parish boys.\nThe vast majority of the scarlet coats of\nour officers that are a little worn find their\nway to the great annual fair at Leipsic.\nThere is a belief in the trade that the des\ntination of this bright scarlet cloth is the\ncuffs and facings of the civil officials in the\nRussian government. However this may\nbe, the fact of second-hand regimentals\nfinding their way to the great German fair\nis undoubted. The pepper-and-salt great\ncoats of our infantry go to our agricultural\ndistricts and to the Cape, but the heavier\nand more valuable artillery cloaks find their\nway to Holland; and that country and Ire\nland absorb between them the cast-off\nclothes of the police. There is one odd\nitem of old clothhs that has a singular his\nI tory. There are still a certain class in the\ncommunity addicted to the use of silk vel\nvet waisteoats~ After adorning the re\nspeetable corporation of some provinelal\ngrooer until he is thoroughly tired of it,\nf what does the reader think is sth ultimate\nf destination-the pate of some street Ger\nman or Potis\u00b7 h Jew.\nI. lo bediesee i.

But old\nclothes, after they have served the purposes\nof two or three classes of society, are yet\nfar from closing their career; when they\nhave seen their worst they take altogether a\nnew lease of existence. When old clothes\nare too bad for anything else they are still\nfood enough for shoddy and mungo. Bat\ney, Dewsbury and Leeds have seen de\nseribed as the grand centresof woollen rage\n-the tatterdemalion capitals, into which\nare drawn all the greasy, frowsy, cast-off\nclothes of Europe, and whence issue the\npilot-cloths, the petershams, the beavers,\nthe talmas, the chesterfields and the mo\nhairs in which our modern dandies disport\nthemselves. The old rage after being re\nduced to the condition of wool by enor\nmous tootb-wheels,are mixed with a varving\namount of fresh wool, and the whole is ihen\nworkedup into the fabrics we have men\ntioned, which now have the run of fashion.\nIt is estimated that shoddy and mungo\nsupply the materials for a third of the wool\nlen manufactures of this country. Here is\na grand transformation. No man can say\nthat the materials of the coat he is wearing\nhas not been already on the back of some\ngreasy beggar. In one corner of the \"ani\nmal products department\" in the South\nKensington Museum, the visitor can see\nhundreds of specimens of this shoddy and\nmungo-a perfect resurrection of the old\nclothes from every country in Europe. The\ncast-off wardrobes of civilized man, by a\nlaw of commerce are sucked into this\ncountry, and mainly into this metropolis,\nand in return we distribute it in perfect\nlabrics, destined to go onee more the round\nof civilization. Hops, we are told, of a\ncertain quality, cannot be grown without\nthe manure of land rage. Thus, the final\ndestination of old clothes, after all, is the\nhuman frame, and we only finally lose sight\nof them when, instead of clothing this vile\ncorpus, they are transmitted into the body\nitself, as we quaff the foaming tankard, or\nthe more genteel bottled bitter of Bass or\nAllsop.\nLAESaT BY TELEGMA PH.\nNew York, Jan. 8.\nThe New Governor, McGrath, of South\nCarolina, has issued a proclamation calling\non all free white men between the ages of\n16 and 60 to come to the defense of Charles\nton, willingly if they will, but forcibly if\nnecessary.\nThe Rlichmond Enquirer suggests the\nhanging of certain merchants in *ilming\nton, who refised to takef nfa'. deref\nThe Times' special says it is rumored\nthat Sherman has communicated to the\nPresident that the Georgia State authori\nties have applied to come back into the\nUnion, and that Secretary Stanton's visit\nto Savannah is doubtless in connection\nwith this subject.\nThe Times says, Gen.

It is near two and\na half years in place of two.\nIf our citizens generally would do their\nduty as well as you, Mr. Editor, and send\nin reliable statements of facts in regard to\nthe agricultural, mineral and other re\nsources of their localities, we would have a\npaper that would be a credit to our Torri\ntorT, be more profitable to the owners, more\nuseful to ourselves, and contain much ask\ned-for information for our friends abroad.\nWe need no puffing or gassing about paper\ntowns or uncertain mineral resources, for\nMontana has within her borders plenty that\nis valuable : a healthy climate, pure moun\ntain water, fertile valleys, almost boundless\npastures, and when to these are added our\nimmense mineral wealth, we have enough.\n1 see by the letter of your Bannack cor\nrespondent, \" Franklin,\" that our Legisla.\ntors are dealing largely in special legisla\ntion -the greatest legislative curse of our\nWestern States. The writer has lived some\nthirty years in the Western States and Ter\nritories, Illinois, Iowa, Wisconsin, Minaso\nta, and Colorado, and has seen all of them\nmore or (less cursed by private acts for\nferries, bridges, roads, and incorpora\ntions &c., where a general incorporation,\nroad, bridge, os ferry law would save much\ntime in \"leg rolling\" and \"wire pulling,\"\nmuch legislative labor, lessen the bulk of\nand simplify the statutes. and ivte all an\nmignt get fewer town lots, oyster suppers\nand drinks, but then they would serve their\nconstituents better. MIxza.\nThe Overlamd Iall LiM e.\nFrom the annual report of the Postmaster\nGeneral we learn that contracts have been\nentered into with the contractors for carry\ning the Overland Mail between Atchison,\nKansas, and Folsom, California, from Oct.\n1st, 1864, to Sept. 30th, 1868. Ben. Holla\nday is the contractor from Atchison to Sal;\nLake at $365,000, and Wmn. Dinsmore car\nries it from Salt Lake to Folsom, for $385,\n000; making a total cost of $750,000 per\nannum. The contracts are for carrying\nthrough letter mails, mails prepaid at letter\nrates and way mailJ. Thus it will be seen\nthe letting is based upon the law of March\n5th, 1864. Most people in this country\nhave been in great doubt as to the actual\nsituation of the Overland mail contract.\nThis settles it.\nAs pertinent to this subject we notice by\nthe Congressional Globe that Hon. John F.\nKinney, Delegate in Congress from the Ter\nritory of Utah, introduced in the House of\nRepresentatives on the first day of the\npresent session of Congress, the following\nresolution, which was read, considered and\nagreed to :\nResolved, That the committee on the Poet Oice\nand Post Roads be instructed to inquire into the xu\npediency of introducing a bill, at an early day of\nthe present session of Congres, repealing the fol\nlowing fourth section of an act entitled \" An act\nto provide for carrying the mails of the United\nStates to foreign ports and for other purposes.\"\n\"SKc. 4.-And be it further enacted, That all\nmailable matter which may be conveyed westward\nbeyond the western boundary of Kansas, and seat\nward from the eastern boundary of Califorvia,sba!l\nbe subject to prepaid letter postage: Provided,\nThat this section shall not be held to eatead to the\ntransmission by mail of newspapers from a known\noffce of publication to bona fde subscribers, not ex\nceeding one copy to each subscriber, nor to franked\nmatter to and from the intermediate points between\nthe boundaries above named, at the usual rates:\n'Provided, further, That seach franked matter shall\nbe subject to such regulations as to its traa~miaion\nand delivery as the Postmaster General shall pre\nscribe.\"\nThe fact that the resolution was so\npromptly adopted augurs well for the pas\nsage of the law it contemplates. If Mr.\nKinney can effect it, it will place him high\nin the affections of the people of the west\nern Territories. All that Congress will\nthen have to do will be to authorize the\npayment of extra compensation for carry\ning the increased mail over the present\ncontraFt. The Overland mail has heretoq\nfore been estimated to cost one million 0\ndollars per year, but the actual coimaect\nis one fourth less.

N. S.\nBIamnac Correspeodence.\n[From our Special Correspondent.\nBANSACK, Jan. 27th, 1865.\nDuAR POST :-Allah be praised ! the As\nsembly, in common with the rest of crea\ntion, is thawing out. Mr. Bagg is contem\nplating some legislation for the protection\nof grizzly bears and other game, against\nthe inclemencies of our winters. I was a\nspectator at an interview between a \"Young\nAmerica \"-a regular Rocky Mountain ga\nmin, and a ereditable citizen of Bannack,\nbut who is native and to the manor born.\nOur aboriginal friend was clothed in\nneither purple nor yet fine linen, nor for\nthat matter had he a superabundance of\nclothing of any quality, and might have\nbeen mistaken by a careless observer for a\nConfederate soldier. :My young friend,\nwithout the formality of an introduction,\naddressed him as follows: \"Scalp women\nand tomahawk emigrants, will you, you old\ndevil. We (implying a partnership at least\nwith the clerk of the weather) are giving\nyou hell now,\" although a cursory exami\nnation of the thermometer would satisfy\nthe most casual observer that the Indian\nwas getting nothing of the kind, on the\ncontrary, quite the reverse.\nHonorable members and Legislative bum\nmers have drank nothing until yesterday\nfor a week. So sudden a change of habits\nof course would produce serious results\nif no specific were found which would pro\ntect them from the fatal effects of tem\nperance. For this purpose, for a week,\nthey have been eating pieces of ice-said\nto be a sovereign remedy. The mercury\nin the thermometer, for a week, has been\nso far below 40 deg. as to be out of sight,\nbut we caught a elimpse of it on day be\nfore yesterday. Mr.Baugg fully thawed out\nto-day, but, if he does not repeat it, I will\nmn.intain secrecy until the Legislature\ncloses. When a man designs and does so\nwell sober, I do not feel anxious to tell his\nfantastic tricks when - asleep!\nThe Assembly is busy. It has passed the\nElection Law, designating the first Monday\nin September as the day of our regular\nelection. There is to be an attempt to pass\na special election law for your county, but\nas it is purely a partisan measure, it can\nnot command the required strength, and\nwill fail. Private bills are passed by for\nthe more pressing duties of the session,\nalthough I would not discourage those who\nhave \" axes to grind,\" provided they are\nable and willing to \"pay the iaddler.';\nAnd this last remark leads me to say that\nthere are in this assembly, some of the most\nvenal, corrupt, and shameless legislators in\nin the world. They who \"do\" the statutes\nfor Pandemonium would shun their com\npany. This letter, however, cannot be con,\nsidered an expose. Men openly in the\nstreets propose to sell votes for a given\nprice, and in any legislative body that ever\nbefore congregated, would be kicked out\nincontinently, We all remember non. 0.\nB. Matteson in Congress in 1855, who for\ndoing privately, what is here a public and\noft-repeated thing, was unanimously kicked\nout of that body. \"It is a private bill;\npay me if you want my support,\" As if\nany bill cbuld be so private as not to affect\nfor many years, if not for all time, the wel- 1\nfare.of this people. Mr. Sanders, of your\nplace, is stid to be the author of this phil\nosophy, and it has found a number of ar\ndent advocates here. I suppose if McCor\nmick-were the, judge in your county,bhe\nwould take money from the hands of sui:ors\nbecause it was a \" private matter.\" Ous, I\nsay on all sach iniquity, and I hope the peo- I\npie of Madison will mdd who of their del- a\negation as guilty, and\n\"aLk the bsna askedl l d the wordl.\"\nThere is asother matter to whieh I wish\nto refer. These Solosm hate me .st If\nf..tematsely. i\nSBell knews o fury like a womanm anse,\"\nsays the poet, but hers is Platonic love 1\ncompared with the regard in which a venal\npolitician holds a newspaper correspondent\nwho cannot be bribed to conceal his knave.\nry. Well, there was here a very clever,\ncompetent and worthy gentleman, I believe\nfrom your county, by the name of D. D.\nChamberlain. Honest, capable and faith\nful, the Governor thought. and so he gve\nhim the appointment of Sherif of beer\nLodge county, and when it came before the\nCouncil, the weak heads refused to confirm\nthe appointment. Poor Chamberlain.\nKeep away from this assembly. You know\nthe story of Mr. Tray.\nI am promised the \"inside history\" of\none piece of legislation, and if it is not too\nblack and disgraceful, I will send it to you\nfor publication. But do not think all are\nrascals. There are hands in this assembly\nunstained by bribee, whom these vultures\nhave never dared to approach, be it said to\ntheir immortal honor, and by and by it will\nbe my pleasing duty to give you their\nnames.\nOne House passes a bill locating the Cap\nital at Virginia; the other checkmates it\nby passing a similar bill locating it at Ne\nvada. Butwhat will be the result I cannot\ntell.\nI must close this letter. I know this will\nfill the bosom of this assembled wisdom with\nsudden and crushing sorrow, but, gentle\nmen, there is no use in weeping; I shall\nnot reciprocate the feeling, and shall only\nsay au revoir.\nUnless the warm weather continues a\nweek, I shall date my next letter from Cen\ntral America, where I suppose Walker's\nclaim is liable to be jumped. But here,\nthere, or elsewhere, I shall not forget my\ndear friends of the Assembly, and if I ever\nget well settled on the shores of the Carrib\nean sea, there are several of its members\nwho can'easily get mnahogany for their cof\nfins by drawing a draft therefor on\nFaANKLIN.\nLATEST BY TELEGRAPH.\nNew York, Jan. 11.\nLate rebel papers contain an interesting\ndetailed narrative of the late Union raid\nof Generals Stoneman, Burbridge and\nGillem, in East Tennessee and West Vir\nginia. So damaging was it to the enemy\nin the destruction of the salt and lead\nworks and a vast amount of other property,\nthat though an effort is made to represent\nthe extent of the injury as much less,\nit was very great. He derives some conso\nlation from the fact that, as the Yankees\nhave now done all the harm in that region\nthat they are capable of, some rest for the\nrebel troops is hoped for.\nA sharp discussion is now going on be\ntween the rebel papers, in which Jeff Davis'\nmeddling is charged as the cause of all their\nrecent disasters. Some of them, in his de\nfence, assail Gen. Lee as the mar-plot.\nThe Herald's army of the James corres\npondent says. all in camp, except General\nButler himself, appeared greatly surprised\nat his removal. If the removal was caused\nby the Wilmington failure, it was inquired\nwhy it was not sooner made. The answer\nto this was, that Gen. Ord, who tempora\nrily succeeds Gen. Butler, was absent and\nthe authorities only awaited his return.\nGen. Butler received the order about half\npast eleven on Sunday forenoon, and before\nthree in the afternoon, he had made all his\nfarewell preparations, turned over the army\nto his successor and taken his departure\nfor the north.\nThe Herald's Shenandoah corsespondent\nsays, the inhabitants are suffering from\nscarcity of food and the rebel troops are\nquartered upon them, rendering their con\ndition still more deplorable. No. new ac\ntive military movements of importance\nhave taken place recently in the valley.\nA Was-ington dispatch says, Secretary\nFebsenden has asked a modification of the\nlaw, so as to enable him to issue $200,000,\n000 more 7 3-10 bonds. The vote on the\nConstitution amendment bill will be post\nponed several days, to allow full discussion.\nThe Herald's Washington dispatch says,\na leading peace Democrat, who has taken\na prominent part in the peace movements\nduring the late election, and whose person\nrelations with the Presidnt have been very\nfriendly, has gone to Richmond, and will\nbe probably heard of there in a day or two.\nPortland, Me., 11.\nThe Moravian from Liverpool 29th, Lon\ndonderry 30th, has arrived. Gen. Dix's\norder to pursue rebel raiders into Canada\nattracted much attention. Leading jour\nnals hope it will not be acted on, as it might\ncause trouble. The papers generally dis\ncountenance the idea of being driven into\nunfriendly relations with the United States,\non account of the raiders in Canada. The\nTimes shows that the rebels could desire\nnothing better.\nThe Herald's special says, orders have\nbeen telegraphed to Denver for the arrest of\nCol. Chivington, for the slaughter of the\nIndians near Fort Lyon. Orders have also\nbeen sent to seiza all the property taken\nfrom the Indians, together with the rem\nnant who escaped the slaughter, and have\nthem taken care of at the expense of the\nGovernment, until disposition can be made\nof them.\nCairo, Jan. 11.\nThe remnant of Hood's army, it is re\nported, are fortifying Corinth, with the\nview at going into winter quarters at that\nplace. They are also said to berepairing\nthe Mobile and Ohio Railroad.\nNew York, Jan. 11.\nThe London Times says if the United\nStates Government ia so ill-advised as to\nsend its troops (o the Canadian border, a\nvery serious misunderstanding between the\ntwo countries msa. be the consequence.\nThe Daily News says the order of GOe.\nDix will be disapproved by the Washutinpo\nauotorities and says, the plea which world\nalone watritat such s couoase weuld be are\nfusal of the Canadisn aufhoritice to ad\nminister justice and preservq tbedeties of\nnautrals. Such, however;', bhapp)ly Do\nfoundation.\nThe` Star eondemns the action of Oea.\nDix and says it was uncalled for.\nThe resolution passed in Congress, in\nreference to Canada, is regarded as tending\nto .ecomplish a position already seriously\nembarrassing.\nThe Post thinks the promptitude of the\nCanadian Government fn its Order tore-ar\nrest the raiders, is substantial testimony to\nits own good faith and will have a re-assur\ning effect in Washington and New York.\nThe New York correspondent of the Lon\ndon TimeJ points out that the Federal Gor\nernment gave notice, in October, of the\nquestion to increase its armament on the\nlakes, and will therefore, be able, by the\nopening of navigation on the St. Lawrence,\nto have as many war ships as it can. The\nBritish Government will find itself, about\nthe 15th of April, with only a vessel to op\npose the Federal feet.\nThe Daily News publishes a letter from\nGoldwin Smith, asserting his conviction\nthat the sinking of the Florida was entirely\naccidental. He defends the language of\nthe American Press on the subject and pays\na high compliment to the loyalty and de\ntermination of the American people.\nThe English papers highly compliment\nLincoln on his manly and temperate lan\nguage in respect to the raiders. They trust\nthat all danger of war will be averted. A\nwar with England, they state, would be the\nheaviest armed intervention that could take\nplace on the part of the South.\nReductions of the army are to be effected\non a grand scale in Austria and Italy. It\nis said that the Italian reduction will be\n85,000 men.\nAugusta, Me., Jan. 11.\nThe Hon. William Pitt Fessenden was\nelected U. S. Senator to-day, for six years\nfrom the 4th of March. Nathan A Farwell\n.was elected for the unexpired term caused\n)by the resignation of Fessenden, to take\ncharge of the Treasury Department.\nNew York, Jan. 12.\nThe World's special says, the Democratic\npolitician who has gong on a peace mission\nwith the approval of the President is Gen.\nSingleton of Illinois. He preceded Blair a\nday or two.\nIt is said that the rebel Congress adopted,\nin secret session, a resolution to appoint\npeace commissioners and they have been\nselected and sent to Grant's head-quarters.\nMessrs. Orr, of South Carolina, Gilmore\nof North Carolina, and Alex. H. Stephens\nare the commission. It is also said that\nGrant has telegraphed that Stephens has\nsolicited permission to pass through his\nlines to visit Washington,\nIt is at last known that Blair goes to\nRichmond with the full knowledge and con\nsent of the President, and is clothed with\nthe authority to open negotiations with Jeff\nDavis, with a view to restore peace, and\nthe rebel authorities will feel assured of\nthis when he shows his cedentials. His\ninstructions are embraced in three propo\nsitions, first, amnesty to all, no matter what\nthey may have been since the war began ;\nsecond, the Constitution as it is, and the\nUnion as it was, the South to return to the\nUnion with all the rights and privileges\nwhich it held before any of the States se\nceded; third, the total abolition of slavery\nfrom this. On this point the President\nwon't retract one iota:. He does not insist\non immediate abolition, but he does that\nmeasures be taken to secure its extinction\nwithin a reasonable length of time.\nIt is stated, on what seems good author\nity, that Jeff Davis is strongly inclined to\npeace measures, and is willing to accept\nmore liberal terms than it was first suppos\ned he would. Lincoln, on the other hand,\nis disposed to be as lenient as possible, but\ninsists that the first public action on the\npart of the South must be to lay down arms\nand acknowledge the supremacy of the 1\nUnion. There is no desire to humiliate the\nSouth-it is to bow to the Union, not to'the\nNorth.\nAs an instance of the temper of the ad\nministration to obtain peace, it is stated\nthat Gen. Butler was removed, not solely\nfor his incompetency and misdemeanors,\nbut also as evidence that our government\nis disposed to treat with the south on libe\nral terms, and is willing to remove any ob.\nstacles that may stand in the way of a per\nfect understanding with that section.\nIt is reported that ex-Governor Rives and\nex-Governor Orr are now on their way to\nWashington, on a peace mission.\nThe Richmond papers of Monday con\ntain a telegram fromp Charleston, stating\nthat a portion of Sherman's forces have oc\ncupied Grahamsville, South Carolina, 35\nmiles north of Savannah.\nThe Charleston Dispatch of the 6th says,\nthe enemy crossed New river, on the road\nto Grahamsville en the 5th.\nHIood's official report of his defeat has\nbeen received. IIe 'put as good a face upon\nit as possible, but he acknowledges the loss\n50 guns in one day.\nBeauregard telegraphs from Macon, that\nHlood reports from Tupela, Mississippi, that\nThomas was moving up the Tennessee river\non the 4th, with 6 gunboats and 60 trans\nports, towards Eastport.\nThe Herald's Shenandoah Valley corres\npondent says there are rumors that the\nrebels have moved down to Strasburg, but\nit is thought they are not of sumcient\nstrength to annoy Sheridan.\nThe Times Washington special learns that\nthe rebel peace commission consists of Vice\nPresident Stephens, Judge White of Geor\ngia, Messr. Boyee and Orr of South Car\nolina, Leech and Gilmore of North Car\nolina, Rives of Virginia, and Smith and\nSingleton of Mississippi. This special al\nso says, it is feared there is no hope of\npa.4ing a constitutional amendment aot-\ntahing slavery.\nCincinnati, Jaa. iZ\nCincinnati, Jan. 12\nAresolution Lee passed the Ohi.

The\nHouse has been engaged the greater part\nof the time in discussing the amendment\nto the Constitution abolis ing slavery. The\ndebate continues to-day. It is not likely\nthat the vote will be reached this week.\nSt. Louis, Jan. 11.\nIn the Missouri Constitutional Conven\nStion, the committee on emancipation re\nported the following ordinance at noon,\nwhich h just passed the convention by a\nvote of 40 to 4.\n\" Be it ordained, by the people of the\nState of Missouri, in convention assembled,\nthat hereafter in this State there shall be\nneither slavery nor involuntary servitude,\nexcept in punishment of crime, whereof\nthe party shall have been duly convicted.\nAll persons held to service or labor as\nslaves are hereby declared free.\nThe resolution for the repeal or the re\nciprocity treaty has passed the Senate by a\nmajority of 31 to 8.\nIn the House, Elliott introduoed a sub\nstitute for the bill to re-organize the rebel\nstates, providing that none of them shall\nbe allowed to resume their politicai rela\ntions, until the loyal citizens organize a\ngovernment republican in form and forever\nprohibitin; involuntary servitude ; and fur\nther, providing that Louisiana shall resume\nher political relations under her constitu\ntion adopted in '64.

He asserts that their\nlines of defence were unsurpassed ia\nstrength and are objects of universal ad\nmiration, and says, he has refused to order\nthe useless sorifice of his soldiers, know\ning their willing obedienoe and devotion to\ntheir country's cause. A portion of the ad\ndress is directed to the colored troop, of\nwhose bravery and idebty he speaks mn the\nwarmest terms.\nLouisville, Jan. 12.\nThe Journal learns that a few days ago,\nthe rebel Major Taylor sent a flag of truce\ninto Hardinsburg, offering to assist the\nhome guard to protect that town against\nguerrillas.

The Admiral\nsays, only the sadden falling of the water\nand the prevalent fog enabled the rebels to\nescape the gunboats. All the pontoons anad\nother means of crossing below Bainbridge\nwere destroyed, and thousands of Hood's\nmen were consequently seattered through\nthe woods on the north side of the river.\nThe Admiral discloses a dispatch which\nhe received from Gen. Thomas, dated Pu\nlaski, Tenn., Dee. 29th, in which the latter\nsums up, as far as then known to him,\nHfood's losses in men and artillery from the\ntime he crossed the Tennessee northward.\nHe puts them down at 19 geieral ofeers,\n14,000 men killed, woundet and captured.\nRather singularly, though, he does not in\nclude Hood's killed and wounded in the\ntwo day's battle before Nashville on the\n15th and 16th.\nThe Herald's bShenandoah valley orree\npondoent mentions the rumor that Sheridam\nis to have a new and very important eos\nmand;\nDetails of the Union raid of Col.

We observe also\nthat journals and politicians of the fearful\norder are agitating themselves over a sup\nposed necessity for pledging the support\nof Ohio to Iresident Johnson, at the\nState Convention, June 21, and over a\ndivision that is to be developed on that\nmotion. These idea seem to mistake the\nnature of our Government, and the rela\ntions between the .peoplp and th Presi\ndent, and to over-estimate the capacity of\nmass meetings and State Conventions.\nIn this republican Government the\npeople are called the sovereign, and the\nPresident their-fervant. They engage\nhim for a term of service. They express\nsentiments to guide him. They support\nhim when his, acts suit them ; not by meet\nings or resolutions, but by electing Rep\nresentatives in political harmony with\nhim. When his acts do not satisfy them,\nthey turn and vote for Representatives\nwho will oppose him, or in disgust they\nlet the election go by default into the\nhands of his opponents, and at the end of\nins term of service they choose another\n''man. No mass meeting orJ3tate Conren\nition can make them do any-afferent from\nthis; therefore this support is all that\nairy organized body ca pledge to the\nPresident.\nWere it otherwise, we should have a\nfew politicians, for the sake of helping\njtheir chances for the President's official\npatronage, binding the people absolutely\n, to support the President in whatever he\nmay do. It is well that they cannot be\nbought or sold in that way, for there\nwould be plenty of traders. The Presi\ndent knows that no party or State organic\nx&tion can promise lun the support of the\npeople or pa?ty any longer than while hjs\npolicy pleases them ; and that when they\npledge him popular support in advance\nof measures, and while his policy is yet\nexperimental, or not clearly developed,\nthey imitate the free trading of the satan\n. ic personam, who proposed to pledjre the\nwhole world tor a personal eonsid ration,\nwhen he had not a quit title to a foit of it.'\n, In absolute monarchical governments,\nthe subjects bind themseb. es, or are held\nbound, to support rulers without condi\ntiocs, on the principle that the king rules\nbydivin right and is infallible. But\ntti is a republican Government, and the\npositions of sovereignty and subjection\nare reversed. If the people are capable\nof their sovereign qSce, they will in their\n.mass meetings and conventions express\ntheir opinions on public affairs for. the ad\nvice and encouragement of the President,\nthey will give him the moral support of a\ndeclaration of sound practical principles,\njrith the assurance of their hearty support\nas long as he adheres to them.

No wonder that, under these cir\ncumstances, the poll of Lincoln county,\non Tuesday, was scarce a third its legal\nvoters. Doubtless many persons vere\nprevented from attending the election at\nall, pud for the reasons stated.\nThat this was the case is very evident\nfrom the oihcial returns received of the\nvote of Lincoln. We have satisfactory\nevidence that-nearly or quite three-fourths\nof the legal voters of Lincoln were op\nposed to the proposed Constitution. Yet\nthe opposite party litis carried tiie county\nby a majority of 44. . There are about\n2,000 leiral voters in Liucoln.

It is not\nwithin the bounds of credibility that such\na result would, or could have been reached\nbut for the previous threats made, and\nthe lawless intimidation to which allusion\nhas been made.

We are in favor of re\ntaining our water front end wharf interest as they\nhave be-m settled by the Onltn Bills, recognizing\nthe fee of this property in the State, to be admin-\nktered by the wharf commissioners for the purpose\noi bnilurug a sea wail out of the revenues of the\nwharves, so that the iulerest of commerce may be\nsubserved, the rights of the State protected, and\nthat eventually our port, dock and wharf charres\nmay be rcductd to the lowest possible figure. AVe\nrecognize Iha title 1 1 outside lands in the city and\nthink they should be administered for the benefit\nof the people, respecting the equity of those who\nbine occupied at'.d improvedin good faith, reserv\ning enough lands for municipal uses, and that the\nsurplus fbould be disposed of for homesteads to j\nthose who deire to enjoy them at a nominal price.\nthe city not to make money in the sale of land.\nBelieving thit tho best iiitcrL'st of the municipal\ngovernment lies in the prosperity of all its citizens,\nwe aro ia favor of it registry law. so that while\nevery person legally '\"on titled to the elective fran-clii-e\nmay enjoy it without hindrance, it may pre\nvent illegal voting, liookiiigxiipon tho elective\nprivilege as the most sacred right of a citir.cn, we\nthink the ballot-box should be guarded by ihe\nstrictest legislation, and if any person entitled to\nvote is too ignorant or too careless to cause his\nname to be registered, let the loss of his vote teach\nhim to be more vigilant in the future. Y.'e are in\nfavor of legalizing primary elections in order to\nprevent fraud, preserve order and Secure a, fair ex\npression at the primary or party ballot. t is iin\n4ios:.iblc to anticipate the various measures which\nwill come before the next Legislature ; nor do we\ndeem it all important to exact from every candi\ndate a pledge upon each particular question likely\nto nrise. . 4\nJleiolretJ. That, sound policy requires that no\nKuropcan Government shall be permitted to con\ntrol the destiny of tho poople of ilexico against\ntheir will, and that our Oovernnent will carry out\nthe wishes of the American people by declaring\nto tho European Governments that the Monroe\nDoctrine will be maintained at all hazards on the\nAmerican continent. Tho resolutions were unani\nmously adopted. The Committee on Nominations\nstated their inability to report, owing to their not\nhaving had time to hunt up candidates, ihe con\nvention then adjourned until this evening.\nSan Francisco, Aug. 13.

Jewish Sabbath. A Jew could not quit\nhis camp, his village, or his city on the day of rest.\nlie misrht not begin a journey; if going along a\nroad, he must rest from snndown till the same\nevent of tbe coming day. He might not carry a\npencil, a kerchief, a shekel in his belt; if he re\nquired a iiandkerchicf for use, he had to tie it round\nhis leg. 'If he ofRnded against one of these rules,\nhe was held to deserve the doom awarded to tho\nvi!e:-t sinners. Some rabbins held that a man\nAught not to change his position, but that whether\nhe was'standing or sitting when thesbofa sounded,\nha should stand or sit, infmovable as a stone, until\nthe Sabbath had passed away. It was only in -the\nsjnagogue anil the temple, chiefly in the tomple,\nthat the Jewish, ru'ue could be set at nought. A\nlaw which put an end to gilts and sacrifices in the\ntemple would have suited tho ehief priests and\nnigu priests, ami these emiling Sadduoees tanght\nthe old sacredota! rule that there was no Sabbath\nin holy things. A cripple could nor carry his rug\na mile, a hungry man could not tduck a craiu of\nwheat; but the teniplo might be lit, the shew-bread\nD&Kea, tue altars might be trunmed and guarded,\nthe shekels might bo paid in to the receiver, the\ndevea and heifers might be slain, and the victims\nmight be burnetii with fire. In the temple courts\nthe seventh da was tho busiest of all the week,\nfor on the Sabbath every Jew who made an offer\ning tu Ctpd was expected to present two shekels in\nstead of one shekel, two doves iustead of one dove,\nand two rims instead of oae ram.
