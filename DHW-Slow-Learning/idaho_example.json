Haven's division assault*\ned Fort McAllister on the 15th, and carried\nit, capturiug the garrison and stores. This\nopened the channel to the Sound, by which\nbe communicated with the fleet. All the\nrailroads leading into Savannah are destroy\ned, and the city invested. The left is on the\nSavannah River, 15 miles above the city, and\nthe right on the Ogeechee, at King's Bridge,\nSupplies are abuudant and the army in good\ncondition. Two boats were captured on the\nSavannah RiVer, preventing the rebel\ngunboats from coming down. The estimated\nm\npopulation of Savannah is 25,000 : garrison,\n15,000. Hardee is in command. He says he\n\"destroyed over 200 miles of railroad, and\nmany stores essential to Lee and Hood. He\nconcludes by saying, *' 1 regard Savannah as\nalready gained.\"\nThe Herald's correspondent says Sherman's\nentire loss from Atlanta to Savannah was\nabout 1000\u2014traveled about 12 miles per day.\nThe fight around Nashville is still going\non. It is reported that Wood is in Hood's\nrear, and that the rebel forces at Franklin\nwere retreating ; also rumored that Forrest\n' was routed at Murfreesboro on the 15tb.\nRichmond papers say Foster's raid on the\nSaTannuh railroad was a failure, and that\nSavannah is not invested. A proposition is\nmade in Congress to tax all sales one per ct.,\nwhich meets with favor. Copies of orders\n</t Breckinridge are published, ordering his\nmen to husband small arms, ammunition and\nlead. A call and draft for 300,000 more\ntroops has been made by the President . m Bur\nbridge had a fight with Basil Duke's brigade,\nformerly John Morgan's, in Tennessee, routing\nhim and killing Dick Morgan, John Morgan's\nbrother. A rebel rumor says Hood is to be\nreinfprced by Price, Breckinridge and Ma\ngruder. Forrest is near the Hermitage. Hood\nhas fallen back from Nashville, and Thomas\nis pressing him. Wilmington is supposed to\nbe the point aimed at by tbe great expedition\nfrom Hampton Roads. A letter from Lord\nRussell says the British Government will\ncontinue strictly neutral. Dayton, American\nMinister at Paris, is dead. Semraes is on tbe\nSea King, whose name is changed to Shenan\ndoah. The vessel is heavily armed, and 1000\ntons register and very fast.\nThe Yreka Journal of December 9tb,\u2014\n\u00abays it rained and snowed for the\nthree weeks previous, and the country has\nbeen under a flood, causing a great deal of\ndamage. Scott river was difficult to cross ;\nHumbug creek was a river, and Yreke creek\nwas \"booming; Shasta Valley was flooded,\nbat the bridge escaped destruction.\nCol.

How the wind\nsweeps down the narrow Cnfion ! bow madly\nit besieges our little homes that we have\nbuilded here for tbe sake of jobbing these\nbarren old hills of their sepulchered god of\nmen and women. The weather has been very\nmuch akin to a Webfoot winter for the past\nfew days. All day the streets have been\nsloppy and the men hurrying along distress\nedly, dripping and grumbling about the rain.\nTo-night it is dolefully doleful.\n*\u2022 Heart-broken moans the homeless mind\nAs if the whole world was unkind.\"\nNovember is truly a month of sobrietiePj\nof melancholy reveries of gentle memories,\nof half regretful recollections ; it i3 not meet\nfor giddy fancies, for joyous hopes or gay air\npalaces.\nWhen the winds and the rain are weeping\nover us, we too bow our beads and bewail\u2014\nnot bitterly, but with a kind of satisfaction\u2014\nover our broken hopes and weep with the\nNovember rain that the Summer blooms have\nfaded. We say no more the high and hope\nful things that once we said, but witb subdued\nspirits we look back as if through blinding\nrain to tbe misty scenes of the Past and\nwhisper\u2014\" it might bave been.\"\nYes, \"it might have been.\" It might bave\nbeen always Summer, tbe bright flowers\nmight, never have faded, nor the gay leaves\nperished. Fair brows might forever be fair,\nand \" golden hair stay golden ; \" dancing\nfeet might never lose their fleetness, norring\ning voices their music ; buoyant youth might\nuever collapse into old age,\u2014nor hopeful\nhearts, once warm and quick witb love and\njoy, become tbe'borne of dull remorse and\nchill-corroding care.\nSitting here to-night listening to the storm\nand somewhat blues-oppressed, l feel like\ndoing a little wailing myself :\nMY WAIL.\nThe shadows are crouching and filling the room,\nWithout the wild wind blows ;\nAud I sit here in the silence and gloom\u2014\nThis is the life I chose.\nAll day long while the chill rains fall,\nI sit in my chamber and write, 4\nAnd then with the darkness that covers all,\nCome thronging the shadows at night.\nI write of lovo and of broken hearts,\nOf a rest that will come at last,\nAnd smile to think of one I knew,\nAway in the shining past.\n\u00bb\n\u2022To think how over his youthful face\nThe death-white palor came,\nWhen I told him that night in my gauze and lace,\nI had bartered my Love for Fame. \u2022\nThere are voices away in the Long Ago,\nThat could banish the shadows and pain.\nBut tbe Past is laid in a sepulchre low\u2014\u00ab\nIt never will come again.\nLeave, cold shadows, my silent room,\nCreep back from my empty heart;\nLet the past be hid in the silent tomb,\nLet the spectral shadow depart.\n44 Deeply, darkly, beautifully blue,\"\nThis is the life I chose,\nSitting here in the silence and gloom\u2014\nWhere is the \"colour de rose ?\"\nThere, I, have wailed my wail I Now for\nsomething else.\nTHE MINES.\nAll flimsy fancies and idle poetical dream\ning must give way at times to something\npractical and bard. I know of no subject\nmore practical than making money, and gold\nis hard\u2014bard to get, and hard to keep.\nThe mines in this place, I believe, average\nvery well. Some pay big, and some bigger;\nsome pay little, and some less\u2014and some not\nat ail. This is the information I elicited from\na friend of mine. I cannot speak from prac\ntical knowledge, not being a miner myself.\nA very good looking miner came in the\nother evening with his gold pan, and said he\nwanted to show me how much be had taken\nfrom his claim that day. I think there was\nabout a quart of tbe ponderous metal iu the\npan. I offered to introduce him to a nice\nImmigrant girl, but he did not seem to think\nmuch of it.\nCANYON CITY.\nCa\u00fcon City may be destined to become a\ngreat city, and it may not. At any rate it is\nimproving quite rapidly, and some very stylish\nlittle houses are being erected. The Catholic\nChurch is now completed. It is a neat ouild\ning for a mining camp, and stands away up\nun the hill overlooking the town like a guar\ndian angel.\n\u2022 But for fear of trespassing on the columns\nof your pretty little paper, I will bring my\nletter to a close.\nBy the way, we polled quite a nice little\nmajority for McClellan here\u2014or rather our\nmeo did, us \"females\" of course having\nnothing to do with it\u2014but alas 1 it did no\ngood.\n\u00ab^Advertisements, to insure insertion, must be band\ned in os early as Thursday, and the number of insertions\ndesired should be noted on the margin.\nReligious Notices.\u2014 Rev.

The\nWashington correspondent ot the Portland\n(Maine) Advertiser, gives the following facts\nshowing what is the remaining strength of\nthe white forces of the Confederacy, and how\nvery far removed the Southern people are\nfrom exhaustion :\n\" Not one-third of the able-bodied white\nmen of the South have as yet entered the\narmy. The South bad 1,000,000 white men\n-of the proper military age, when the war be\ngin, and 200,000 boys who bave since attain\ned to that age, making 1,800,000 men. The\nStates have furnished up to this time, in all\n850,000 men, of whom 558,000 have perished\nin battle, or by disease. 60,000 are now\nprisoners in our bands, 20,000 are iu bospi\ntala, slightly wounded, and 212,000 constitute\nthe Confederate armies now in the field. They\nhave yet 550,000 white men, from which to\nkeep their armies full, and they do not there\nfore need -the negroes as soldiers.\"\nThose who boast that the war is near an\n\u2022ending, will do well to study these figures.\u2014\nAdd to this the vast number of able-bodied\nnegroes who can and will be summoned to the\nfield, when they deem it politic or necessary\nand the greatness of the work of conquest\nand subjugation yet before the Administra\ntion is made fully apparent. The war as\nprosecuted by the party in power, is only in\nits infancy. The work of \" crushing out the\nrebellion,\" is to be an unending one if noth\ning but brute force is to be employed.\nPolitical Theology. \u2014A correspondent of\nthe Boston Courier, gives the following in\nstances of pulpit interference with the recent\n\u2022lection :\nOne saintly orator proclaims from his pul\npit, recently gilded by urgent appeals from\nthe El Dorado of priests and laity, that every\nvoter at the coining election must feel that ne\nha\u00ab the sacramentt I bread in his band.\nBut on Sunday last, a young friend who has\n^devoted himself to the country's cause in\nmany & well-fought battle, stepped into the\nTremont Temple, in the hope of listening to\nGod's holy word. In lieu of Such a service,\nappropriate to the day, he beard a violent\ndenunciation of Gen. McClellan, and a sym\npathetic and blasphemous harangue in favor\nof Mr. Lincoln, ending as follows: \"Stand\nmp for God ! Stand up for Jesus 1 Stand up\nfor Abraham Lincoln 11\"\nThe late Rev.

He illustrates our\nrampant Americanism by a quotation from\nthe book of Judges. It is there told, as a final\n________ \u201e .\ntfifect of Israel's war with the Pbillistines,\u2014\nthat, \"lo llio.e days there was no King in\ndid that which\nIsrael, but every man\nright in his own eyes.\"\nThan which, continues he, \" ft more faith\nful picture of the men seen in Broadway and\nthe Bowery, at the present moment, could\nnot possibly be written.\" Mr. Willis then\nproceeds in his observations: \"Yet the\nbriakiag out of this pustule of corrupt mat- I\nter on the face of our feverish nation\u2014 1 \" 15\none-man insolence\u2014 \u00ce3 seen no more under\nthe military outton than under the rags of |\nthe beggar.

And it is not seen\nmerely in the twirling of a moustache or the\ndefying of an eye; but who that bas an oc\ncasion to ride in a car, or mingle, as a stran\nger, now-a-days, in a crowd of our great city,\ncan be pleased with the new manners which\ndo certainly prevail\u2014the shouldering and\nelbowing, the rough jostling and rude lan\nguage, the indifference, sulky and savage of\nevery man to his neighbor, ar.d the complete\nun-deferential conduct of every gathering\neverywhere, it for their own independent\npleasure\u2014of men, women and children ?

The whole number\nof votes cast was seven hundred and thirty\nthousand seven hundred and twelve, of which\nthree hundred aud sixty-eight thousand sev\nen hundred and twentj-six were given for the\nLincoln and Johnson electors, and three\nhundred and sixty-one thousand nine hun\ndred and eighty-six for the McClellan and\nPendleton. The Republican majority is\ntherefore six thousand seven hundred and\nforty. Mr. Greeley, one of the Republican\nelectors at large, received two hundred and\nthirty-five votes less than his colleague, Mr.\nPreston King. Between the numbers re\nceived by each of the Democratic electors at\nlarge there was a variance of but five votes,\nMr. Washington Hunt receiving that many\nmore than Mr. Wm. Kelly.\u2014[New York Pa\nper, Dec. 10.\nImportant Decision. \u2014In the case of Pedro\nCasttllo against the Pacific Mail Steamship\nCompany, for $25,600 damages for insufficient\naccommodations as a passenger, and the loss\nof $6,500 in treasure on the Golden Gate,\nthe case ineolcing the entire qneation of the j\nliability of the Company for losses on the\nsteamer, the Court rendered a verdict for the\ndefendants on the ground that the Company\nwas not liable in cases of the total loss of |\na vessel and cargo, and that the receipt did\nnot set forth the exact character, amount and j\nvalue of the package so lost.\n_ \u201e ,, , .\nSCALDSANDBURNS.-Dr. Hall says the best,\nmost instantaneous and most accessible rem\nedy in the world, is to thrust the injured part\nin cold water, send for a physician and while\nhe i9 coming, cover the part an inch or more\ndeep with common flour.

Leader, writing \" from the front,\" on the\nPotomac, or James, says :\nA little further on l came to a reliable de\nserter, who lay on a sand heap scratching\nhimself. These deserters are very nice fel\nlows.\nAs I approached he rose and saluted.\n\"Jes'came f'm 'tuther side, gin'ral,\" says\nhe.\n\"What do you want,\" says I.\n\" I'm powerful dry,\" says he.\nI called an orderly and bade him fetch some\nwhisky.\n\" Now,\" says I, 11 how's things overon your\nside ? \"\n\" Well,\" says he, \"pretty bad. Old Lee,\nhe ain't got no men whatsomever.\"\n\" I guess you lie,\" says I. \" We felt his\nline the other day, and it didn't feel good.\nYou might just as well tell the truth.\"\n\" Oh 1 \" says be, I was only speaking figu\nratively like. He ain't got no men to speak\nof\u2014fifty or sixty hundred thousand, mebbe.\"\n\" H'm, that's enough,\" says I.\n\"Yes, only they ain't good for nothing.\nThey ain't got no ammunition.\"\n\" Tney keep up a devil of a firing,\" says I,\n\" for men without ammunition.\"\n\" Wal, yes,*' says he, \" that's what's run\nthe blockade. Thar's a\ntiou runs the blockade.\"\n\" Short of rations ? \" says I.\n\" Dreadf l short,\" says he. \" We don't get\nonly a cracker every three days.\" .\nII Why, I killed a lot of you up yonder\nwhile ago with their knapsacks full.\"\n\" 0, yes. That's wh&t they got f m the\nShandoah Walley. They got a heap of food\nup yonder. Fact, they h^s all they want to\noat, jes now.\"\n\" You're bound to suit, arn't you,\" says I.\n\" How are you off for ordnance?\"\n\" 0, our ordnance is orf'l,\" says he.\n\"Yes,\" says I, \"Is'pose so. But, young\nnaan, I've got an ordnance, too, about offal,\nand I keep it pretty well cleared out of these\nlines. Now you'd better clear out. I go in\nfor treating my fellow men well, but when it\ncomes to rebels, and lying deserters, and ly\ning deserters at that, I can't say I see it.\nWhat do you expect to do round here?\"\n\" VV^ell,\" says he, \" I kinder thort I'd go\nNorth and play Union refugee. I'm told it\npays fust rate at Lincoln meetin's.\"\n\" And how are you going to get to the\nNorth ?\" \u00bb\n\" I s'pect you'll send me.\"\n\" Do you ?\"\n\"Yes ; if you don't, I'll jes' go back again\nto old Lee, and tell him all I seen in your\nlines.\"\nThis is wha\u00a3 I call a good S^ecinlen of a\nrebel. He went iu for dictating his own\nterms. 1\nI sent him np to headquarters and had him\nhanged.\nOld Abe's Last. \u2014In dismissing & party of\nthree hungry office-seekers, who had often\nwearied him, Mr. Lincoln reminded them of\ntbe schoolmaster who told one his pupils to\nread the third chapter of Daniel. The boy\nbegan, but when he came tbe names of Shad\nrach, Masheck and Abednego, he stumbed.\nTbe master told the boy he might read the\npreceding chapter, and let the present one\ngo. He got on famously nntil he reached the\nlast verse, when, pausing, and casting a sav\nage glance at the book, he exclaimed : \"Well,\nI'll be darned if here ain't them three fellers\nagain 1\", f\n\u2022\nr\n^\nThe Abolition Successor of, Washington\n^ Mr. Lincoln was at first, says the Patterson\n(IL J.) Register, accidentally elected to the\nPresidency of the United States, arid his lack\nof statesmanlike qualities and the culture\nand habits of a gentleman was not so direct\nly a disgrace to the people of this country as\nif he had been fairly elevated to the \"Chief\nMagistracy by a fairly expressed majority.\u2014\nBut the people cannot now escape the odium\nof .having put a mere joker, an uncouth, un\ncultivated fiatboatman, a buffoon, into the\nseat which a Washington honored. The\nmajority of the people so voted, however, and\ncannot avoid the disgrace. Now let every one\nwho gave bis ballot for \"Abraham Lincoln\nread the following {the truth of which is\nvouched for by the World), and rejoice if\nthey can over the elevation of such a man as\nMr. Lincoln, whose classical conversation is\nreported thus:\n\"How do you New York Democratic chaps\ntake my election?\" asked Mr. Lincoln, a few\ndays ago, of a prominent New York McClel\nlanite, with whom the Executive is pleased\nto be on good personal terms. \"Oh, pretty\nWell, on'.he whole,\" was the reply. \"Some\nof Our boys complain, however, that you\ncarried the State by your postmasters steam\ning the envelopes that contained McClellan\nand Seymour votes, thus opening the envel\nopes and substituting Lincoln and Fenton for\nMcClellan and Seymour ballots.\" \"Ha, ha,\"\nlaughed the President, leaning forward and\ngrasping his ancles tightly; \" so they say, do\nthey, that 1 came the 'gum game on them'\nto be re-elected 1 Well, there's one comfort\nabout it, old fellow ; and this you can tell\nthem for me: that if I tried to cheat\u2014\nwhich they also did\u2014by gum! I was success\nful, and they wern't !''\nAnd that is the successor of George Wash\nington 1 i\nA Noteworthy Fact. \u2014An exchange very\ntruthfully remarks that you can always tell\nfrom the advertising columns of a newspaper\nwho do the largest business and sell the\ncheapest. The business man gifted with en\nterprise and industry, having goods to sell,\nwill strive to outstrip his competitors, and\ninform the public through the press what he\nhas for sale. This is so, and if our readers\nwish to test the fact for themselves, let them\nmake a note on their next shopping tour of\nthe difference to be noticed between the es\ntablishments of advertising and non-adver\ntising firms. There will be found evidences\nof thrift, indications of prosperity in the ad\nvertising firm, a \" snap\" and wide awake air\nabout the employers and clerks, in striking\ncontrast with dull-, plodding ways of the \" old\nfogies,\" who don't \" waste \" money in adver\ntising. If purchasers wish to know where\nthey will find the choicest goods and the\nnewest styles, they will carefully study the\nadvertising columns of their home paper,\nThe examination of drafted men in tbif\ntown closed on last week. Of the 211 men\ndrafted 1 was dead ; 2 were non-residents ; 62\nwere discharged on the ground of disability;\n46 paid cdmmutationf 49 failed to appear;\n3 were under age; 9 Were overage; 3 fur\nnished substitutes' 14 were in the service;\nand 16 are yet to pay or furnish substitutes.\nOf the three substitutes, one is now in jail\ncharged with murder. So that but two men\nout of the number drafted have found their\nway into the army and they are Canadian\nsubstitutes. One might fairly infer from\nthese facts that Old Abe's war for the nigger\nis not very popular. \" The people (\u00ee\u00ebmhnd\na vigorous prosecution of the war.\" Will\nthe \"Loyal Leaguers\" hereabouts point out\nthe \"white feather party,\" against which they\nprated so loudly, three years ago. We opine\nthe \" peace party\" is now the dominant one,\nso far as numbers are concerned.\u2014[Eastern\nPaper.\n7\nOnr of the Spirit-Wrappers.\u2014 A man was\nin the street the other night, who bad evi\ndently taken in too much of the ardent for\nconvenient storage, and was rather unquietly\nresting himself against a lamp-post, when an\nacquaintance came aloDg, and observed that\ntbe afflicted individual had on a new over\ncoat.\n\"Well, Bob,\" said he, \"guess you have\nbeen indulging in a new overcoat.\"\n\"Coat?\" replied Bob, giving bis hat a\nknock, and endeavoring to gesticnlate; \" this\nain't a coat.\"\n\" Is n't a coat, eh ? Well, Bob, what is it,\nthen?\"\nBcb elevated himself to a tottering pigpen\ndicular, and exclaimed: \"This 'ere ain't a\ncoat\u2014it's a spirit-wrapper !\"\nMasonry. \u2014Oh I who can tell the worth of\nthe Masonic Order?

Upon the introduction of the\n^ Bounty bill, (framed in the \u00dfanctum of his\nExcellency, and, therefore, his pet,) party\nlines were drawn, and woe be to the waver\ning. The mandate of his Highness had gone\nforth, that the pretext for robbing the hardy\npioneers of Idaho should receive the sanction\nof the Legislature ; that it might be legiti\nmately done under statute law. The friends\nof the bill were disinclined to give its pro\nvisions a very extensive airing,\u2014choosing,\nrather, to pass the matter through without\nattracting much attention. At length it\nbecame understood that, did they succeed\neasily in the Council, the House was not\ndisposed to allow so gross an outrage upon\nthe people of this Territory to be perpetrated\nwith impunity. Although so modified as to\nseem not wholly impracticable on its face,\nstill the tax levied under its provisions\nsolely for a \"bunkum\" record to lay before\nFather Abraham\u2014amounted to $45,000. The\nfirst proposition called lor $144,000, which\nwas much nearer the actual amount needed.\nHuge \" bunkum \" speeches from the Repub\nlicau members (who need re-election to keep\ntheir seats) were made, lauding the Adminis\ntration to the skies, and denouncing all who\nrefused to fall down and worship the image\nthat Caleb of \" Lyonsdale \" had set up, that\nlor the want of a faithful reporter for your\njournal, will be lost to their constituents\nforever. Praise of worthy mefit is a delight\nful theme; when undeserved, however, it\nbecomes the most withering sarcasm. There\nfore, in claiming tljat \"we owe this to our\ngovernment at home, from the fact that she\nhas ever extended her protecting hand over\nus,\"\u2014and this claim set up in tbe face of the\nfact that, on the contrary, we have so far not\nonly paid all the usual taxes levied by our\ngovernment upon bid settled States,\u2014but we\nfbave also supported, at our o.wn expense, and\nfrom an almost empty treasury, all the dis\nreputable Federal officers sent here. Does\nour government need these troops ? and what\nfor ? If we have to support (in addition to\nthe officers we have no voice in electing)\nstanding army, let the people have some voice\nin the matter. Yoiir correspondent listened\nattentively to the arguments,\u2014or rather\n\"bunkum,\" of the Republicans in both\nHouses, and it was also generally observed\nthat they left the merit of the bill untouched\nSeveral good third rate Fourth-of-July ora\ntions were had over it, and finally the funeral\n6ermon was duly preached over it, and its\ncompanion\u2014the Militia bill, by the Reverend\nmember, in the House, from Idaho. Thus\n10 xvv\nfoil as mad a scheme, and as destructive to\nthe best interests of the Territory, as ever\nentered the brain of a fanatic.\nThe last day of the session at length came,\nand with it a rather rich joke not wholly\nwithout its lesson. During the passing of\nparty measures through the Council, of course\nthe Democracy were in the minority. This\nenabled the Republicans to choke off discus\nsion frequen'.ly, without authority of law, or\nthe rules of \" Jefferson's Manual.\" Upon\nseveral occasions this was done with impuni\nty, and the Chair, sustained by a majority, of\ncourse, and at the expense of the minority.\nHowever, an opportunity occurred for a little\nsport, which had been concocted in the House,\nby going into Joint Convention, and a reso\nlution was passed through both Houses to\nthat effect.* Here was an opportunity to get\njustice, as we would have a clear working\nmajority. A series of resolutions reviewing\nthe conduct of Federal officers, who had been\nsent amongst us, were hastily drawn up, and\nat an opportune moment offered by Mr. Fenn\nof the Council, from Idaho. In a moment\nthe countenances of tbe Opposition members\nchanged from the self-satisfied smile of tri\numph won by them, for the last three weeks,\nto the most blank look of surprise. The\nreader can better imagine the ludicrous\nspectacle presented if, in his schoolboy days,\nhe ha3 seen a large boy domineer, tyrannize\nover, aad tantalize a smaller one before the\nwhole school until, by some unforeseen in\ncident, he comes suddenly in contact with his\nvictim and finds himself completely in his\npower. As might be expected from former\nconduct, tbe \" big boy \" ran away. Thus it\nproved with the Council majority\u2014they\n\"bolted\" from the house, disgracefully leav\ning the field, and refusing to accept an equal\nshow and a fair fight\u2014saluted with shouts of\nlaughter from the lobby as they went. This\nis Republican honor and sound Republican\ninciple?.\nTHE CAPITAL, AND OTHER QUESTIONS.\nThe Capital question is becoming rather a\nvexed one to everybody. Your correspondent\nnot being in the ring, can give but little infor\nmation with regard to it. Blackstone seems\nto have been consulted in the matter and, if\ncorrectly interpreted by some of the ' Solons,'\nI fear they will decide the last Assembly a\nbogus body sure enough. This will sadly in\nterfere with the operation of many healthy\nlaws passed during the last session.\nThe different applicants for tbe office of\nTerritorial Auditor and Territorial Treasurer,\nwill, also materially retard the business in\nthose offices. I havejust learned that Dr. M\nA. Kelly, who was elected Territorial Treas\nurer, has his bonds ready and will apply for\na certificate ; also, that Dr. E. Smith, appoin\nted by the Governor and Legislative Council\nis preparing his;\u2014meantime, writs y of in*\njunction are being served on D. S. Kenyon\nforbidding him deliverfng over to either any\nbooks, records, or papers, belonging to said\noffice,\u2014to which he also puts in a claim that\nhe was duly appointed to for the term pre\nscribed by the statute, viz. : two years.\nThese numerous questions will hardly be\ndecided until near the expiration of the term\nclaimed by Kenyon. Thus the matter stands.\nPallas.\nDemocratic Central Committee, Ada Co.\nheld at Boise City, Ada county, I.
